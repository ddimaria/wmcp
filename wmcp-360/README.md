## Lifetime Role of Wealth

### Life-Cycle Theory

Developed by Nobel prize–winning economist Franco Modigliani (and later with Albert Ando), Life-Cycle Theory aims to maintain a consistent lifestyle throughout one's life via strategies in planning and saving.

The St. Petersburg paradox states that the marginal value of money to an individual diminishes as his wealth rises.  The St. Petersburg paradox is relevant to investment planning because it illustrates the importance of diminishing marginal utility.

#### Utility Theory

Utility Theory details how investors should allocate money over their life once they determine how much income they’ll earn in the future.  Utility is derived by using money to purchase goods and services.

Marginal utility is the utility gained by an addition of money (e.g. one dollar).  Utility theory can be viewed as decreasing marginal utility of consumption.  That is, we get deminishing returns in utility as we increase wealth or income over a certain threshold.

### Consumption Smoothing

Consumption smoothing is the equal division of money for consumption over the estimated remaining years of life.

The earning path is the rise in income over time as well as the large reduction that happens at retirement.

Decreasing marginal utility means that equal consumption each year is optimal.

#### Planning Horizon

The planning horizon is the estimated length of time for a financial plan (life expenctancy).  Life expectancy is just an estimate derived from using Life Tables that match the individual's demographic.

The life expectancy for a newborn male is 76 and 81 years for a female.  
If a male or female is alive at 65, they can expect to live 18 and 20 more years respectively.
Higher-income individuals live an average of 4 years more than the average American, while lower-income live an average of 4 years less than the average American.  The gap between higher and lower income individuals averages 8 years.

Joint mortality is the probability that one spouse will be alive after a given age.

The appropriate retirement planning horizon for most 65 year old individuals is 30 - 35 years.

### Utility Maximization

Utility Maximization looks to maximize the happiness of each dollar spent rather than soley focusing on wealth maximization.  There are diminishing returns in utility as individuals accumulate wealth beyond a threshold.

Humans don't like risk and prefer security, though risk is tolerated if a reward is involved.

### Income Volatility

Human capital is a person's ability to be productive (i.e. earn income).  Human capital is affected by risks in market forces (variable job supply and compensation) or health (accidents/illnesses).  Saving is a buffer that can help smooth volatility.

Working in an occupation whose profits are closely tied to interest rates is a market risk to the value of human capital.

#### Disability and Life Risks

##### Disability Risks

* **Loss of Earnings**: Illness or injury can greatly reduce lifetime earnings.
* **Amount Replaced by Insurance**: Disability policies differ in what they protect.  Ensure human capital loss is provided to limit disability risk.
* **Elimination Period**: The time between the ilness or injury and when the worker start receiving disability insurance benefits. The most common elimination period is 90 days (but can be 30 - 720 days).  Longer elimination periods are cheaper, but less useful in the short term.
* **Adverse Selection**: People with higher disability risk are more likely to purchase disability policies, which places natural upward force on premiums.  Those with average risk still pay a higher preimum due to adverse selection.

##### Life Risks

* **Death of a Breadwinner**: Life insurance is an earnings and lifestyle hedge against the death of the primary breadwinner.
* **Adverse Selection**: Adverse selection is minimized due to physicals requred by life insurance.
* **Measuring the Amount of Life Insurance**: The amount of life insurance needed can be determined by calculating the net present value of expected future earnings.  
* **Contingent Claims**: As workers age, their amount of life insurance needed decreases.

### Life-Cycle Uncertainty

#### Bequests

Bequests (leaving a legacy) should be deducted from lifetime permanent wealth.

> (lifetime wealth - bequest)/planning horizon
> 
> No bequest: $3,000,000/50 years = $60,000/year
> 
> Including bequest: $3,000,000 - 500,000/50 years = $50,000/year

Since we cannot guarantee a planning horizon (life expectancy), life insurance can be used to guarantee a legacy amount via Risk Pooling.

News of an unexpected inheritance will most likely lead to an increase in permanent income and a reduction in the savings needed before retirement

#### Lifespan Uncertainty

TODO

## Life-Cycle Framework

### Returns over the Life-Cycle

#### Rates of Return

Returns on assets are in the form of Capital Gains (increase in value) and Income (interest/dividends). The **Rate of Return** is the return expressed as a percentage of the value of an asset.  These rates are unknown at the time the asset is purchased.

The **Real Rate of Return** is the inflation-adjusted rate of return.  **Inflation** is the increase in the cost of goods and services over time.

Higher rates of return improve the lifestyle of **savers** but reduce the lifestyle of **borrowers**.  

A positive real rate of return reduces the cost of buying income in the future.

### Uncertain Returns and Utility

Should one pay $3,000 has a 50% chance of either returning $5,000 or $1,000 in 1 year?

Calcluate average utility:

**NOTE: ALL Calculations below are important to memorize**

> ln = natural log
> 
> we take the average b/c there is a 50% chance of either return happening
>
> Avarage Utility = (ln(5000) + ln(1000))/2 = (8.52 + 6.91)2 = 7.72

Calculate the expected future amount
> we times by 0.5 b/c there is a 50% chance of either return happening
> 
>Expected Future Amount = .5(5000) + 0.5(1000) = $3,000

Calculate the amount of spending in 1 year to have a 50% probability of either outcome

> e<sup>7.72</sup> = $2,253

How much would a client pay for a risky investment with a 50% probability of being worth $500 and 50% of being worth $1,000 assuming a natural log utility function?

> (ln(5000) + ln(1000))/2 = 6.5611,  e<sup>7.72</sup> = $707.11


Should we pay $3000? No, we should pay $2,253.

#### Financial Investments in Utility Theory

**Risk Averse** investors prefer consistent payouts vs volatile ones.  A **Concave Utility Function** is used to assess risk. 

**Certainty Equivalence** is a guaranteed return that someone would accept now, rather than taking a chance on a higher, but uncertain, return in the future.  Thus, for a risk-averse individuals to accepts some risk (uncertainty), they need to be presented with higher returns.

Greater variation in the returns of an asset results in a lower price today.  Safe assets have a higher price today.

### Goal Flexibility

Goal based investing matches the risk of a portfolio to the amount of variability the client is willing to take on.

#### Return on Investment Calculation

> $20,000 to invest on a safe asset earning 2% over 15 years:
> 
> $20,000 * (1 + 0.02)<sup>15</sup> = $20,000 * 1.34586833832413 = $26,917
> 
> $26,917 is the furure value of the $20,000 investment.

To limit the downside risk while still having the potential for upsides, a combination of risk-free and risky assets can be chosen.

#### Risk Tolerance vs Risk Capacity

Risk tolerance isn't a great indicator of risk as tolerance changes with the market (up market = high risk tolerance, down market = low risk tolerance).

**Risk Capacity** is the risk somone can take on as still live within their current lifestyle (vs their sustainable living standard).  Having a current lifestyle below one's sustainable living standard is living below or within their means.

The more flexible one can be in future spending, the higher risk they can take on.

### Risk Premium

**Risk Premium** is expected increase in future spending for taking some risk.  It's the return minus the risk-free rate of return (of a risk-free asset).  **It is the expected return above and beyond the risk-free rate of return available on safe assets.**

There is no **expected return** of a risky asset since there is variance in the array of possible returns (volatility).

Some risky assets don't have high potential payouts.  **Informed Market Participants** help pricing reflect the risk of an asset.

> Safe Asset: Expected return of $5 on $100.  5%
> 
> Risky Asset A: 50% chance of $0 return, 50% chance of $15 return on $100.  ((0.5 * 0) + (0.5 * .15))/2 = 7.5%
> 
> Risk Premium of Risky Asset A = 7.5% - 5% = 2.5%

> Risky Asset B: 50% chance of -$10 return, 50% chance of $90 return on $100.
> 
> Minimum Upside Payout: (0.5 * -.10) + (0.5 * x) = 0.075 
  > 
  > = -0.05 + 0.5x = 0.075 
  > 
  > = 0.5x = 0.125 = 25%

So, the upside payout of Risky Asset B would need to be at least $125.


### Risk Preferences

**Risk Tolerance** is the willingness to accept volatility in returns.

**Risk Aversion** is the avoidance of risk, or a low risk tolerance.

A **constant absolute risk aversion** investor is one who holds on to the same percentage of risky assets independent of increases or decreases in wealth.

**Decreasing absolute risk aversion** is the preference to hold on to a higher percentage of risky assets as one's wealth increases.  Thus, wealthier investors tend to have a higher **risk capacity**.

**Modern Portfolio Theory** details that assets with a higher standard deviation of returns (risky assets, like stocks) yield a higher expected return and lower risk assets (e.g. bonds) have a lower return.

High risk tolerant investors prefer to have more assets in stocks that those who are less risk tolerant.

**Prospect Theory** states that investors care about relative wealth and a starting porfolio matters.  This theory assumes that investors are loss averse, so they have a higher sensitivity to losses compared to gains.

**The Certainty Effect** is the preference for investors to lock-in less risky (and thus lower) gains even in the presence of higher risk/higher returns.  Older investors are more suseptible to the certainty effect, and are more likely to seek risk (e.g. gamble) to avoid taking a loss.

### Risk Management

A **Contingent Claims** is a special type of financial assets that pay out when a negative, unexpected event occurs (e.g. homeowner's insurance). The expected payout must be less than the price of the asset.  Contingent Claims (insurance) helps an investor meet their financial goals by avoiding a devastating expense (smooths spending via risk pooling).

An **Insurance Load** is the difference between the premium and the average expected claim.  It is the cost of providing insurance.

#### Risk Retention Decisions

As the cost of insurance increases, expected investor wealth is decreased.  High insurance can outweigh it's utility.

Advisors should **always** consider risk aversion.  An investor's ability to withstand a loss informs the necessity of a contingent claim (insurance).  As investor wealth increases, the less chance that a catastrophic event will impact total wealth.

### Mortality and Longevity Risks

**Mortality Risk** is the possibility of losing human capital through premature death.  The probability is low for someone dying young, making life insurance (contingent claim) for young worker relatively cheap.

Cost of insuring a 46 year old man for 1 year.

**NOTE: Calculation below is important to memorize**

> Probability of dying at 46 is 0.1087% or 0.001087
>
> Assume earnings of $150,000/year (nominal) for the next 20 years, the total value of human capital is 20 * $150,000 = $3,000,000.
>
> Actuarially Fair Price = Value of Human Capital * Probability of Dying
>
> $3,000,000 *  0.001087 = $3,261


Insurance companies charge a fee, called a **load**.  

> Market Premium = (Actuarially Fair Price)/(1 - Insurance Load)
>
> Assuming a 10% load: $3,261/(1 - .1) = $3,623

As workers get older, their chance of dying increases, and the total value of their human capital decreases.  In general, Market Premiums increase as workers get older.

Protecting against mortality risk involves reducing consumption each year by the yearly premium amount (Market Premium).

**Longevity Risk** is the risk of outliving retirement savings.

The median longevity ages is 85 for single US males.  We use a longevity to estimate withdraws from accounts.  There is a 27.8% chance that a single male will live to 90 and a 10% chance that he lives to age 95.

**Annuities** hedge against longevity risk.

### Property, Liability, and LTC Insurance

**Idiosyncratic risk** refers to the risk that an investment will experience a decline in value due to factors that are unique to that particular investment. Contingent claims in property and liability can help mitigate idinsyncratic risks.

As the number of possible negative events occuring (**risk exposure**) increases, insuring for individual events can negatively impact future wealth.  

> Negative return on an insurance policy (**insurance load**) = premium paid - claims paid.

For modest losses, it may be best for the individual to absorb the cost rather than get insurance for it.

#### Rational Decisions about Property and Liability Insurance

How do we make rational decisions about insurance:

1. Identify the most significant loss exposures. Property loss is limited to the price of the property, but liability loss can be unlimited.  Thus, liability risk should be mitigated by insturance.
1. Understand the load of the insurance product.
1. Understand the insurance deductables. **Risk retention limit** is the amount below which the insurer will retain risks.
1. Have emergency funds to cover multiple insurance product deductables in catastrhophic events that affect multiple policies.
1. Wealthier individuals should hold more liquid assets in order to increase risk retention limits.
1. More loss averse individuals will likely want lower deductibles.

**Loss Exposure** is the possibility that a loss can occur.  A distinction exists between *property loss exposure** and **liability loss exposure**.  Property loss happens when propery is actually damaged while liability loss is incurred whenever a claim is submitted since there are significant costs associated with defending a claim.

#### Property Insurance

Property insurance only covers actual loss (aka ***covered peril**).  2 main categories: Real Property (land and anything on the land) and Personal Property (property other than Real Property).

#### Disability Insurance

**Disability risk** increases as individuals get older.  **Long-term disability** is a disability lasting more thn 90 days.

#### Liability Insurance

Liability insurance covers defense costs and claims payouts.  **Compulsary damages** reimburse a claimant who suffered a loss.  **Punitive damages** punishes someone whose conduct causes another to suffer a loss.  Liability insurnace typically covers compulsary damages.

#### Umbrella Liability Insurance

Umbrella Liability Insurance protects against the possibility of losing personal capital and other assets by serving as a barrier between wealth and lawsuits.  It provides high limits of excess liability coverage and broader types of coverage well beyond basic underlying home and auto policies.

The **Self-Insured Retention Limit (SIR Limit)** is a deductible that is required for a policy owner to pay in the event that an underlying policy doesn't cover (aka **Drop-Down Coverage**).

#### Long-Term Care and Wealth Protection

Up to 70% of baby boomers will require Long-Term Care (LTC).  Women have more LTC risks than men.  LTC also affects wealthier individuals more.

##### Approaches to Meeting LTC Risks

The focus should be on an infrequent, but expensive, LTC event.  Larger elimination periods (time before policy kicks in) will be less expensive and transfer catastrophic loos risk to the insurance company.

Medicaid is an option, but has many limitations and requirements that drain capital and may involve inferior services.

##### Types of LTC Policies

* **Single coverage contracts** enable spouses to obtain coverage at different levels.
* **Shared coverage contracts** cover both spouses and unused LTC benefits of a deceased spouse carry over to the living spouse.  These contracts increase the chances of the spouses maximizing benfits.
* **Long-term care partnership programs** protect assets from Medicaid spenddown requirements.
* **Fixed inflationary benefits** protect against currency and medical cost inflation.

##### The Best Time to Purchase LTC Insurance

LTC policies are cheaper when one is younger (policies at 60 are 2x what they are at 50).  Life insurance products offer hybrid policies that add LTC riders.

## Value of Goal-Based Approach

### Elements of Financial Goals

3 main elements to financial goals:

1. Desired future amount
1. Time horizon between the investement and the payout
1. The payout

2 important questions to ask:

1. Are you willing to accept variations in your goal?
1. Are you flexible in your goal amount?

The **trade-off of investment risk** is taking on more risk in order to get higher returns.

Safe investments are easier to estimate than risky ones.  Safe investments estimates are simply made from the current market of low-risk investments (e.g. T Bills).  Risky investments require analyzing historic returns.

### Life-Cycle Goals

The value of goals:

* Matches the investment strategy to the time period of spending goals
* Established objectives for long-term planning
* Reduces client anxiety (avoids **myopic loss aversion**)
* Create opportunities to discuss priorities

Goals are set to focus on long-term strategies, avoiding short-term results emphasis.

By setting goals, we can evaluate progress and adjust accordingly.  They help clients focus on incremental savings by focusing on the overall goal (i.e. keep you eye on the prize).

**Long-term goals can be valuable at motivating short-term actions.**

Goal characteristics:

* Time horizon (increasing a horizon -> riskier asset allocation)
* Flexibility (greater flexibility -> riskier asset allocation)
* Immunization (match the payout of the goal with a bond's duration...safe)
* Prioritization (optimizes resources to focus on the most important goals)

**Unrealistic goals** require discussing tradoffs and flexibility to make them more realistic.  There's a tendency to take on more risk than is desired to meet unrealistic goals, which is not in the best interest of the client.

**Not assuming realistic asset returns will result in a client's inability to make realistic choices about the amount of money needed to save in order to meet goals in the future.**

### Risks and Goals

Asset Risk example:

Risk-Free Portfolio: 1% expected return, 0% standard deviation
Conservative Portfolio: 5% expected return, 7% standard deviation
Aggressive Portfolio: 8% expected return, 15% standard deviation

There is a 13.5% chance it could take longer than 4 years with a conservative portfolio.
There is a 15.6% chance it could take longer than 4 years with an aggressive portfolio.
There is a 1.3% chance it could take longer than 10 years with an aggressive portfolio.

Investment risk **always** adds risk that goals will not be met in volatile markets.

### Liquidity and Goals

**Liquidity** is an aspect of **asset flexibility** that details the degree to which an asset can be converted into cash.

Pure liquid assets: cash and cash equivalents (checking and savings accounts)
Highly liquid assets: stocks and bonds

Stocks and bonds vary in their degree of liquidity.  Stocks and bonds in **shallow markets** (lack of active market of frequent trades) are less liquid that those that are actively traded (deep markets).  Shallow markets force longer sell times and/or lower market sale prices.

Less liquid assets enjoy a **illiquidity premium**, resulting in higher returns to offset the longer sell times.  Illiquid investments include real estate, collectibles, private business assets, and tax-sheltered/tax-deferred accounts.

Illiquid assets have higher transaction costs.  If liquidity is planned in a certain time horizon, investors should prefer more liquid assets.

Having liquidy can be psychologically beneficial for some investors.  Conversely, illiquidity can help some investors "stay the course" as they may avoid the higher transaction costs and lower sale prices.

**The primary risk of using a volatile asset such as a stock mutual fund for liquidity is that the investor may be forced to sell in a down market.**

### Goal Prioritization

Essential goals should be prioritized above non-essential ones.

> Essential Goals > Important and Inflexible Goals > Flexible Goals > Aspirational Goals

Steps in prioritization:

1. Estimate savings needed for each goal
1. Determine time horizon flexibility of each goal
   1. Less time horizon = less risky assets, long time horizon = more risky assets

Goal prioritization helps clients understand the tradeoff of saving more for an essential goal means saving less for lesser goals. 

#### Retirement example:

Assumptions:
* Retire in 15 years
* 3% return on safe assets
* 7% return on risky assets

> Emergency fund ($96,000 in 3 years): inflexible and short time horizon, 100% safe investments

At 3% returns, they need to save $2,550/mo to have $96,000 in 3 years.

> Basic Expenses ($500,000): essential and long time horizon, 70% safe investments, 30% risky

Expected return per year = (0.7 * .03) + (.3 * .07) = 4.2%/year.  That's about $2,000 per month to save $500,000 in 15 years.

> Lifestyle Expenses ($500,000): flexible and long time horizon, 40% safe investments, 60% risky

Expected return per year = (0.4 * .03) + (.6 * .07) = 5.4%/year.  That's about $1,800 per month to save $500,000 in 15 years.
 
> Charity ($500,000): more flexible and long time horizon, 20% safe investments, 80% risky

Expected return per year = (0.2 * .03) + (.8 * .07) = 6.2%/year.  That's about $375 per month to save $500,000 in 15 years. 

**If they can only save $4550/mo, then it's best to save for the emergency fund and retirement basic espenses only for the first 3 years, then use the remaining $2550 to save for lifestyle expenses and charity.**

#### Goals and TVM

TVM (Time Value of Money) helps translate goals into courses of action.  The equation involves estimating a **rate of return**, a **time horizon**, and the **future cost of the goal**.  These assumptions can be modified to evaluate alternatives to achieving the goal.

Example:

> A client needs to save $20,000 in 15 years for college, and already has $500 saved.  Assume a 5% rate of return.

### Social Security Benefits

Established as a baseline income for the elderly. On average, it replace 40% of pre-retirement income.  It makes up 50% of pre-retirement income for 2/3 of all seniors.

TWB = Taxable Wage Base = the maximum wages that are taxed.  It's currently at $125k per year.  Employers and employees pay 6.2%, plus each pay 1.45% for Medicare/Medicaid.  Self employed individuals pay for both sided (double).

The ACA (Affordable Care Act) adds a Medicare surtax of 0.9% for those > $200k (individual) and > $250k (jointly).

OASDHI = Old-Age, Survivors, Disability, and Health Insurance program = Social Security.  

Provides retirement benefits plus disability and families of deceased. 1/6 in the US are in the system (61 million).

90% of US workers contribute to Social Security 

#### Claiming Age

A worker is entitled to receive 100% of thier Primary Insurance Amount (PIA) at their Full Retirement Age (FRA).

Born 1945 - 1954 = 66 FRA
Born 1955 - 1960 = 66 FRA + 2 months per year (e.g. 1955 = 66yrs 2mo, 1956 = 66yrs 4mo)
Born 1096 - now = 67 FRA
Benefit period is from 62 - 70

Claiming at 60:
> 36mo x (5/9 of 1%) = 20%
>
> 24mo x (5/12 of 1%) = 10%
>
> Total reduction = 30% reduction in PIA

Delaying benefits past FRA (capped at 70) increases benefits by 8% per year.  Example:
> 3 years at 8% = 24%
>
> Total increase = 24% increase of PIA

#### Eligilibility

To qualify, a worker must have 40 quarters (10 years) of making $1600 per quarter.

#### Calculating AIME

Average Indexed Monthly Earnings (AIME) characteristics:
* Based on the highest 35 years of income
* < 35 years results in zeros applied to make up the difference
* Yearly capped at the TWB (Taxable Wage Base)
* Earnings up to age 60 are inflation adjusted

#### Calculating PIA

Average Indexed Monthly Earnings (AIME) characteristics:
* 90% of the AIME up to $1000
* An additional 32% of the AIME for $1000 - $5000
* An additional 15% of the AIME for $5000+

The PIA covers more pre-retirement income for lower income individuals than higher ones.

#### Protected Social Security Benefit

The maximum benefit at FRA is currently around $3,600/month ($43k/year).  At 70, this is $4,550/month ($54,600/year).

Calculations aren't necessary if the client can get their online Social Security account.

#### Receiving Benefits

Social Security is a low-risk, inflation protected stream of income.  Deferring at least one claim (for married) often increases the total lifetime benefit.

##### Spousal Benefits

A worker’s spouse is eligible for a spousal benefit (up to 1/2 of the worker’s PIA), subject to 25/36 of 1% per month for the first 36 months and 5/12 of 1% for each additional month PRIOR TO THE FULL RETIREMENT AGE (e.g. 62).

The primary worker must have already started receiving benefits in order for the spouce to clain spousal benfits.

Divorced spouses can claim a benefit if they were married for 10 years or more, and can be initiated even if the primary worker hasn't started receiving benefits as long as both parties are at least 62 years old and divorced for more than 2 years.

##### Survivor Benefits

A surviving spouse can claim the deceased spouses higher benefit.  The benefit amount is determined by the benefit the deceased spouse currently taken.  It's beficial for the higher earning spouse to defer benefits as long as possible to increase the amount of the surviving spouse.

##### Maximizing Benefits

To determine the maximum benefits, perform a net present value analysis.  It's ideal for longevity age to be greater than the break-even age for claming beneits (an incomplete approach b/c of survivor benefits and inflation aren't considered).

Break even ages are typically between 78 - 82.  Loss averse individuals tend to want to claim early, which can reduce overall wealth.

The longer someone expects to live, the later they should claim their benefit (at a max age of 70).

#### Tax Calculation

The taxable amount of social security is:

> (total SS income X 0.5) + other income (modified AGI) + taxable interest

Tax brackets for taxable income (2024):

| Type    | Range           | Tax % |
| ------- | --------------- | ----- |
| Single  | 0 - 24,999      | 0%    |
| Married | 0 - 31,999      | 0%    |
| Single  | 25,000 - 34,000 | 50%   |
| Married | 32,000 - 44,000 | 50%   |
| Single  | 34,001 -        | 85%   |
| Married | 44,001 - 44,000 | 85%   |

#### Social Security Claiming Strategies

Percentage increases by claiming early vs deferring

| Claiming Age | % Increase per year |
| ------------ | ------------------- |
| 62 - 65      | 5%                  |
| 65 - 67      | 6 2/3%              |
| 67 - 70      | 8%                  |

Healthy individuals, high earners and/or married couples benefit more from deferring.

For the average individual, delaying benefits increases wealth.

In order to delay claiming benefits, individuals must have assets to pay for the time between retirement age and social security claiming age (called Bridge Wealth).  Delaying often reduces overall resource needs over the lifteime.

Social Security should be considered to be part of the safe asset allocation in a portfolio.

#### Pensions

Pensions should be considered to be part of the safe asset allocation in a portfolio.  This allows those with pensions to take a greater risk in their invested assets.  Pensions are not inflation protected like Social Security.

## Financial Markets

### Macroeconomics

4 phases of the Business Cycle:
* Trough (Bottom)
* Expansion (Bull Market)
* Peak (Top)
* Contraction (Recession)

#### The Federal Reserve

The primary goals of the Federal Reserve are full employment (low unemployment rate) and price stability (moderate inflation of around 2%).

The Fed has 3 tools:
1. Open market operations
1. Changes in the discount rate
1. Changes in the computation of required reserves

The Federal Funds Rate is the rate banks charge each other (banks with a surples lend to those with deficits).  The Fed has tools to nudge this rate.

##### Monetary Policy

The Fed has 2 main tools for manipulation (**Monetary Policy**):
1. The money supply (M1, the sum of cash in circulation and in checking accounts)
1. Reserve Requirements (The percentage of assets a bank needs to set aside in reserves, usually stored as cash or deposits at the Fed)

###### The Money Supply (M1)
To reduce unemployment and increase inflation, the Fed needs to stimulate the economy via open market operations (the purchase and sale of government bonds and mortgage backed securities).  This increases the money supply and increases bank reserves.  The end result should be that banks are more willing to loan money, expanding businesses and increasing the inflation rate.  Expanding businesses should lead to hiring, reducing the unemployment rate.

###### Bank Reserves

The **discount rate** is the rate the Fed charges banks for loans.  Lower rates should stimulate bank loans to businesses.

##### Fiscal Policy

The Fed has 2 tools for Fiscal Policy:
1. Government Spending
1. Taxation

Fiscal policy affects federal debt. Debt can be financed via bonds.  If the Fed sells bonds, it moves cash to buyers.  The Fed buying bonds is a **monetary policy action**, which gives cash to the Fed to increase government spending.

The **Phillips Curve** is the tradeoff between unemployment and the inflation rate.  Decreased unemployment leads to increased wages.  This raises prices and increases inflation.  The Phillips curve is no longer used.

Increases in the money supply lead to higher prices and business expansion, decreasing unemployment.

Stimulating policies are associated with higher stock prices.  Policies that slow economic activity decrease stock prices. Unexpected changes in Monetary and Fiscal policy can lead to sudden and extensive changes in stock prices.  

If the Fed lowers interest rates, reducing expected returns on stocks and bonds, resulting in higher individual savings rates and less ambitious future goals. If the Fed increases interest rates, volatility is increased in stocks and bonds (esp long-term bonds)

The Fed can lower bank reserve requirements, which also has the effect of banks more freely loaning money.

#### Business Cycles

The National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) defines peaks and troughs in business cycles.  There have been 33 business cycles since 1854.  The longest cycle was 128 months, the shortest cycle was 28 months.  The average business cycle lasts about 70 months (6 years). 

The NBER uses 3 indicies to determine where we are in the business cycle:
1. The index of leading indicators (10 indicators including the S & P 500)
1. The index of coincident indicators
1. The index of lagging indicators

When all 3 indicies are rising or falling, it indicates an expansion or contraction/recession.  We get mixed signals when the economy is at a peaks or a trough.

The stock market isn't good at predicting the direction of the economy.

Modern monetary and fiscal policy has gotten better and decreasing contractions and increasing expansions.  The average cycle time from peak to trough (contraction) has decreased from 18% to 11% since 1945. 
The average cycle time from trough to peak (expansion) has increased from 35 months to 58 months since 1945.

Changing business cycles should not affect current allocations of a well-constructed portfolio.  Portfolios should contain a mix stocks and bonds that match the client's risk tolerance and risk capacity.

#### Market Interest Rates and the Effect of Interest Rates

As interest rates increase, all else equal, the value of the assets decreases.

The Fed signals its intention through its public statements, allowing markets to adjust to expansive or restrictive monetary policy. 

The stock market has performed better when the Fed undertakes an expansive policy. Managers should counsel clients to expect lower returns in a restrictive policy and higher ones in an expansive one.

As interest rates rise, the cost of a company's debt capital (borrowing costs) and equity capital (risk preimium) increases.  This decreases business profitability.

As interest rates rise, consumer spending typically decreases (due to the increase in the cost of debt). Higher costs items are more sensitive to increases in interest rates. Lower cost items are less suseptible to changes in interest rates.

Managers want to decrease exposure to durable goods manufactures and increase exposure to energy, consumer goods, and food sectors when interest rates are trending upwards. 

### Inflation
