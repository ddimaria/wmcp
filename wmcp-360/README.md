# WMCP360: Introduction to Goal-Based Planning

## Lifetime Role of Wealth

### Life-Cycle Theory

Developed by Nobel prize–winning economist Franco Modigliani (and later with Albert Ando), Life-Cycle Theory aims to maintain a consistent lifestyle throughout one's life via strategies in planning and saving.

The St. Petersburg paradox states that the marginal value of money to an individual diminishes as his wealth rises.  The St. Petersburg paradox is relevant to investment planning because it illustrates the importance of diminishing marginal utility.

#### Utility Theory

Utility Theory details how investors should allocate money over their life once they determine how much income they’ll earn in the future.  Utility is derived by using money to purchase goods and services.

Marginal utility is the utility gained by an addition of money (e.g. one dollar).  Utility theory can be viewed as decreasing marginal utility of consumption.  That is, we get deminishing returns in utility as we increase wealth or income over a certain threshold.

### Consumption Smoothing

Consumption smoothing is the equal division of money for consumption over the estimated remaining years of life.

The earning path is the rise in income over time as well as the large reduction that happens at retirement.

Decreasing marginal utility means that equal consumption each year is optimal.

#### Planning Horizon

The planning horizon is the estimated length of time for a financial plan (life expenctancy).  Life expectancy is just an estimate derived from using Life Tables that match the individual's demographic.

The life expectancy for a newborn male is 76 and 81 years for a female.  
If a male or female is alive at 65, they can expect to live 18 and 20 more years respectively.
Higher-income individuals live an average of 4 years more than the average American, while lower-income live an average of 4 years less than the average American.  The gap between higher and lower income individuals averages 8 years.

Joint mortality is the probability that one spouse will be alive after a given age.

The appropriate retirement planning horizon for most 65 year old individuals is 30 - 35 years.

### Utility Maximization

Utility Maximization looks to maximize the happiness of each dollar spent rather than soley focusing on wealth maximization.  There are diminishing returns in utility as individuals accumulate wealth beyond a threshold.

Humans don't like risk and prefer security, though risk is tolerated if a reward is involved.

### Income Volatility

Human capital is a person's ability to be productive (i.e. earn income).  Human capital is affected by risks in market forces (variable job supply and compensation) or health (accidents/illnesses).  Saving is a buffer that can help smooth volatility.

Working in an occupation whose profits are closely tied to interest rates is a market risk to the value of human capital.

#### Disability and Life Risks

##### Disability Risks

* **Loss of Earnings**: Illness or injury can greatly reduce lifetime earnings.
* **Amount Replaced by Insurance**: Disability policies differ in what they protect.  Ensure human capital loss is provided to limit disability risk.
* **Elimination Period**: The time between the ilness or injury and when the worker start receiving disability insurance benefits. The most common elimination period is 90 days (but can be 30 - 720 days).  Longer elimination periods are cheaper, but less useful in the short term.
* **Adverse Selection**: People with higher disability risk are more likely to purchase disability policies, which places natural upward force on premiums.  Those with average risk still pay a higher preimum due to adverse selection.

##### Life Risks

* **Death of a Breadwinner**: Life insurance is an earnings and lifestyle hedge against the death of the primary breadwinner.
* **Adverse Selection**: Adverse selection is minimized due to physicals requred by life insurance.
* **Measuring the Amount of Life Insurance**: The amount of life insurance needed can be determined by calculating the net present value of expected future earnings.  
* **Contingent Claims**: As workers age, their amount of life insurance needed decreases.

### Life-Cycle Uncertainty

#### Bequests

Bequests (leaving a legacy) should be deducted from lifetime permanent wealth.

> (lifetime wealth - bequest)/planning horizon
> 
> No bequest: $3,000,000/50 years = $60,000/year
> 
> Including bequest: $3,000,000 - 500,000/50 years = $50,000/year

Since we cannot guarantee a planning horizon (life expectancy), life insurance can be used to guarantee a legacy amount via Risk Pooling.

News of an unexpected inheritance will most likely lead to an increase in permanent income and a reduction in the savings needed before retirement

#### Lifespan Uncertainty

## Life-Cycle Framework

### Returns over the Life-Cycle

#### Rates of Return

Returns on assets are in the form of Capital Gains (increase in value) and Income (interest/dividends). The **Rate of Return** is the return expressed as a percentage of the value of an asset.  These rates are unknown at the time the asset is purchased.

The **Real Rate of Return** is the inflation-adjusted rate of return.  **Inflation** is the increase in the cost of goods and services over time.

Higher rates of return improve the lifestyle of **savers** but reduce the lifestyle of **borrowers**.  

A positive real rate of return reduces the cost of buying income in the future.

### Uncertain Returns and Utility

Should one pay $3,000 has a 50% chance of either returning $5,000 or $1,000 in 1 year?

Calcluate average utility:

> ln = natural log
> 
> we take the average b/c there is a 50% chance of either return happening
>
> Avarage Utility = (ln(5000) + ln(1000))/2 = (8.52 + 6.91)2 = 7.72

Calculate the expected future amount
> we times by 0.5 b/c there is a 50% chance of either return happening
> 
>Expected Future Amount = .5(5000) + 0.5(1000) = $3,000

Calculate the amount of spending in 1 year to have a 50% probability of either outcome

> e<sup>7,72</sup> = $2,253


Should we pay $3000? No, we should pay $2,253.

#### Financial Investments in Utility Theory

**Risk Averse** investors prefer consistent payouts vs volatile ones.  A **Concave Utility Function** is used to assess risk. 

**Certainty Equivalence** is a guaranteed return that someone would accept now, rather than taking a chance on a higher, but uncertain, return in the future.  Thus, for a risk-averse individuals to accepts some risk (uncertainty), they need to be presented with higher returns.

Greater variation in the returns of an asset results in a lower price today.  Safe assets have a higher price today.

### Goal Flexibility

Goal based investing matches the risk of a portfolio to the amount of variability the client is willing to take on.

#### Return on Investment Calculation

> $20,000 to invest on a safe asset earning 2% over 15 years:
> 
> $20,000 * (1 + 0.02)<sup>15</sup> = $20,000 * 1.34586833832413 = $26,917
> 
> $26,917 is the furure value of the $20,000 investment.

To limit the downside risk while still having the potential for upsides, a combination of risk-free and risky assets can be chosen.

#### Risk Tolerance vs Risk Capacity

Risk tolerance isn't a great indicator of risk as tolerance changes with the market (up market = high risk tolerance, down market = low risk tolerance).

**Risk Capacity** is the risk somone can take on as still live within their current lifestyle (vs their sustainable living standard).  Having a current lifestyle below one's sustainable living standard is living below or within their means.

The more flexible one can be in future spending, the higher risk they can take on.

### Risk Premium

**Risk Premium** is expected increase in future spending for taking some risk.  It's the return minus the risk-free rate of return (of a risk-free asset).

There is no **expected return** of a risk asset since there is variance in the array of possible returns (volatility).

Some risky assets don't have high potential payouts.  **Informed Market Participants** help pricing reflect the risk of an asset.

> Safe Asset: Expected return of $5 on $100.  5%
> 
> Risky Asset A: 50% chance of $0 return, 50% chance of $15 return on $100.  ((0.5 * 0) + (0.5 * .15))/2 = 7.5%
> 
> Risk Premium of Risky Asset A = 7.5% - 5% = 2.5%

> Risky Asset B: 50% chance of -$10 return, 50% chance of $90 return on $100.
> 
> Minimum Upside Payout: (0.5 * -.10) + (0.5 * x) = 0.075 
  > 
  > = -0.05 + 0.5x = 0.075 
  > 
  > = 0.5x = 0.125 = 25%
  
So, the upside payout of Risky Asset B would need to be at least $125.


### Risk Preferences

**Risk Tolerance** is the willingness to accept volatility in returns.

**Risk Aversion** is the avoidance of risk, or a low risk tolerance.

A **constant absolute risk aversion** investor is one who holds on to the same percentage of risky assets independent of increases or decreases in wealth.

**Decreasing absolute risk aversion** is the preference to hold on to a higher percentage of risky assets as one's wealth increases.  Thus, wealthier investors tend to have a higher **risk capacity**.

**Modern Portfolio Theory** details that assets with a higher standard deviation of returns (risky assets, like stocks) yield a higher expected return and lower risk assets (e.g. bonds) have a lower return.

High risk tolerant investors prefer to have more assets in stocks that those who are less risk tolerant.

**Prospect Theory** states that investors care about relative wealth and a starting porfolio matters.  This theory assumes that investors are loss averse, so they have a higher sensitivity to losses compared to gains.

**The Certainty Effect** is the preference for investors to lock-in less risky (and thus lower) gains even in the presence of higher risk/higher returns.  Older investors are more suseptible to the certainty effect, and are more likely to seek risk (e.g. gamble) to avoid taking a loss.

### Risk Management

A **Contingent Claims** is a special type of financial assets that pay out when a negative, unexpected event occurs (e.g. homeowner's insurance). The expected payout must be less than the price of the asset.  Contingent Claims (insurance) helps an investor meet their financial goals by avoiding a devastating expense (smooths spending via risk pooling).

An **Insurance Load** is the difference between the premium and the average expected claim.  It is the cost of providing insurance.

#### Risk Retention Decisions

As the cost of insurance increases, expected investor wealth is decreased.  High insurance can outweigh it's utility.

Advisors should **always** consider risk aversion.  An investor's ability to withstand a loss informs the necessity of a contingent claim (insurance).  As investor wealth increases, the less chance that a catastrophic event will impact total wealth.
