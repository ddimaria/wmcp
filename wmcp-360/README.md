# WMCP360: Introduction to Goal-Based Planning

## Lifetime Role of Wealth

### Life-Cycle Theory

Developed by Nobel prize–winning economist Franco Modigliani (and later with Albert Ando), Life-Cycle Theory aims to maintain a consistent lifestyle throughout one's life via strategies in planning and saving.

The St. Petersburg paradox states that the marginal value of money to an individual diminishes as his wealth rises.  The St. Petersburg paradox is relevant to investment planning because it illustrates the importance of diminishing marginal utility.

#### Utility Theory

Utility Theory details how investors should allocate money over their life once they determine how much income they’ll earn in the future.  Utility is derived by using money to purchase goods and services.

Marginal utility is the utility gained by an addition of money (e.g. one dollar).  Utility theory can be viewed as decreasing marginal utility of consumption.  That is, we get deminishing returns in utility as we increase wealth or income over a certain threshold.

### Consumption Smoothing

Consumption smoothing is the equal division of money for consumption over the estimated remaining years of life.

The earning path is the rise in income over time as well as the large reduction that happens at retirement.

Decreasing marginal utility means that equal consumption each year is optimal.

#### Planning Horizon

The planning horizon is the estimated length of time for a financial plan (life expenctancy).  Life expectancy is just an estimate derived from using Life Tables that match the individual's demographic.

The life expectancy for a newborn male is 76 and 81 years for a female.  
If a male or female is alive at 65, they can expect to live 18 and 20 more years respectively.
Higher-income individuals live an average of 4 years more than the average American, while lower-income live an average of 4 years less than the average American.  The gap between higher and lower income individuals averages 8 years.

Joint mortality is the probability that one spouse will be alive after a given age.

The appropriate retirement planning horizon for most 65 year old individuals is 30 - 35 years.

### Utility Maximization

Utility Maximization looks to maximize the happiness of each dollar spent rather than soley focusing on wealth maximization.  There are diminishing returns in utility as individuals accumulate wealth beyond a threshold.

Humans don't like risk and prefer security, though risk is tolerated if a reward is involved.

### Income Volatility

Human capital is a person's ability to be productive (i.e. earn income).  Human capital is affected by risks in market forces (variable job supply and compensation) or health (accidents/illnesses).  Saving is a buffer that can help smooth volatility.

Working in an occupation whose profits are closely tied to interest rates is a market risk to the value of human capital.

#### Disability and Life Risks

##### Disability Risks

* **Loss of Earnings**: Illness or injury can greatly reduce lifetime earnings.
* **Amount Replaced by Insurance**: Disability policies differ in what they protect.  Ensure human capital loss is provided to limit disability risk.
* **Elimination Period**: The time between the ilness or injury and when the worker start receiving disability insurance benefits. The most common elimination period is 90 days (but can be 30 - 720 days).  Longer elimination periods are cheaper, but less useful in the short term.
* **Adverse Selection**: People with higher disability risk are more likely to purchase disability policies, which places natural upward force on premiums.  Those with average risk still pay a higher preimum due to adverse selection.

##### Life Risks

* **Death of a Breadwinner**: Life insurance is an earnings and lifestyle hedge against the death of the primary breadwinner.
* **Adverse Selection**: Adverse selection is minimized due to physicals requred by life insurance.
* **Measuring the Amount of Life Insurance**: The amount of life insurance needed can be determined by calculating the net present value of expected future earnings.  
* **Contingent Claims**: As workers age, their amount of life insurance needed decreases.

### Life-Cycle Uncertainty

#### Bequests

Bequests (leaving a legacy) should be deducted from lifetime permanent wealth.

```math
(lifetime wealth - bequest)/planning horizon

No bequest: $3,000,000/50 years = $60,000/year
Including bequest: $3,000,000 - 500,000/50 years = $50,000/year
```

Since we cannot guarantee a planning horizon (life expectancy), life insurance can be used to guarantee a legacy amount via Risk Pooling.

News of an unexpected inheritance will most likely lead to an increase in permanent income and a reduction in the savings needed before retirement

#### Lifespan Uncertainty
