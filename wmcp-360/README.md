## Lifetime Role of Wealth

### Life-Cycle Theory

Developed by Nobel prize–winning economist Franco Modigliani (and later with Albert Ando), Life-Cycle Theory aims to maintain a consistent lifestyle throughout one's life via strategies in planning and saving.

The St. Petersburg paradox states that the marginal value of money to an individual diminishes as his wealth rises.  The St. Petersburg paradox is relevant to investment planning because it illustrates the importance of diminishing marginal utility.

#### Utility Theory

Utility Theory details how investors should allocate money over their life once they determine how much income they’ll earn in the future.  Utility is derived by using money to purchase goods and services.

Marginal utility is the utility gained by an addition of money (e.g. one dollar).  Utility theory can be viewed as decreasing marginal utility of consumption.  That is, we get deminishing returns in utility as we increase wealth or income over a certain threshold.

### Consumption Smoothing

Consumption smoothing is the equal division of money for consumption over the estimated remaining years of life.

The earning path is the rise in income over time as well as the large reduction that happens at retirement.

Decreasing marginal utility means that equal consumption each year is optimal.

#### Planning Horizon

The planning horizon is the estimated length of time for a financial plan (life expenctancy).  Life expectancy is just an estimate derived from using Life Tables that match the individual's demographic.

The life expectancy for a newborn male is 76 and 81 years for a female.  
If a male or female is alive at 65, they can expect to live 18 and 20 more years respectively.
Higher-income individuals live an average of 4 years more than the average American, while lower-income live an average of 4 years less than the average American.  The gap between higher and lower income individuals averages 8 years.

Joint mortality is the probability that one spouse will be alive after a given age.

The appropriate retirement planning horizon for most 65 year old individuals is 30 - 35 years.

### Utility Maximization

Utility Maximization looks to maximize the happiness of each dollar spent rather than soley focusing on wealth maximization.  There are diminishing returns in utility as individuals accumulate wealth beyond a threshold.

Humans don't like risk and prefer security, though risk is tolerated if a reward is involved.

### Income Volatility

Human capital is a person's ability to be productive (i.e. earn income).  Human capital is affected by risks in market forces (variable job supply and compensation) or health (accidents/illnesses).  Saving is a buffer that can help smooth volatility.

Working in an occupation whose profits are closely tied to interest rates is a market risk to the value of human capital.

#### Disability and Life Risks

##### Disability Risks

* **Loss of Earnings**: Illness or injury can greatly reduce lifetime earnings.
* **Amount Replaced by Insurance**: Disability policies differ in what they protect.  Ensure human capital loss is provided to limit disability risk.
* **Elimination Period**: The time between the ilness or injury and when the worker start receiving disability insurance benefits. The most common elimination period is 90 days (but can be 30 - 720 days).  Longer elimination periods are cheaper, but less useful in the short term.
* **Adverse Selection**: People with higher disability risk are more likely to purchase disability policies, which places natural upward force on premiums.  Those with average risk still pay a higher preimum due to adverse selection.

##### Life Risks

* **Death of a Breadwinner**: Life insurance is an earnings and lifestyle hedge against the death of the primary breadwinner.
* **Adverse Selection**: Adverse selection is minimized due to physicals requred by life insurance.
* **Measuring the Amount of Life Insurance**: The amount of life insurance needed can be determined by calculating the net present value of expected future earnings.  
* **Contingent Claims**: As workers age, their amount of life insurance needed decreases.

### Life-Cycle Uncertainty

#### Bequests

Bequests (leaving a legacy) should be deducted from lifetime permanent wealth.

> (lifetime wealth - bequest)/planning horizon
> 
> No bequest: $3,000,000/50 years = $60,000/year
> 
> Including bequest: $3,000,000 - 500,000/50 years = $50,000/year

Since we cannot guarantee a planning horizon (life expectancy), life insurance can be used to guarantee a legacy amount via Risk Pooling.

News of an unexpected inheritance will most likely lead to an increase in permanent income and a reduction in the savings needed before retirement

#### Lifespan Uncertainty

TODO

## Life-Cycle Framework

### Returns over the Life-Cycle

#### Rates of Return

Returns on assets are in the form of Capital Gains (increase in value) and Income (interest/dividends). The **Rate of Return** is the return expressed as a percentage of the value of an asset.  These rates are unknown at the time the asset is purchased.

The **Real Rate of Return** is the inflation-adjusted rate of return.  **Inflation** is the increase in the cost of goods and services over time.

Higher rates of return improve the lifestyle of **savers** but reduce the lifestyle of **borrowers**.  

A positive real rate of return reduces the cost of buying income in the future.

### Uncertain Returns and Utility

Should one pay $3,000 has a 50% chance of either returning $5,000 or $1,000 in 1 year?

Calcluate average utility:

**NOTE: ALL Calculations below are important to memorize**

> ln = natural log
> 
> we take the average b/c there is a 50% chance of either return happening
>
> Avarage Utility = (ln(5000) + ln(1000))/2 = (8.52 + 6.91)2 = 7.72

Calculate the expected future amount
> we times by 0.5 b/c there is a 50% chance of either return happening
> 
>Expected Future Amount = .5(5000) + 0.5(1000) = $3,000

Calculate the amount of spending in 1 year to have a 50% probability of either outcome

> e<sup>7.72</sup> = $2,253

How much would a client pay for a risky investment with a 50% probability of being worth $500 and 50% of being worth $1,000 assuming a natural log utility function?

> (ln(5000) + ln(1000))/2 = 6.5611,  e<sup>7.72</sup> = $707.11


Should we pay $3000? No, we should pay $2,253.

#### Financial Investments in Utility Theory

**Risk Averse** investors prefer consistent payouts vs volatile ones.  A **Concave Utility Function** is used to assess risk. 

**Certainty Equivalence** is a guaranteed return that someone would accept now, rather than taking a chance on a higher, but uncertain, return in the future.  Thus, for a risk-averse individuals to accepts some risk (uncertainty), they need to be presented with higher returns.

Greater variation in the returns of an asset results in a lower price today.  Safe assets have a higher price today.

### Goal Flexibility

Goal based investing matches the risk of a portfolio to the amount of variability the client is willing to take on.

#### Return on Investment Calculation

> $20,000 to invest on a safe asset earning 2% over 15 years:
> 
> $20,000 * (1 + 0.02)<sup>15</sup> = $20,000 * 1.34586833832413 = $26,917
> 
> $26,917 is the furure value of the $20,000 investment.

To limit the downside risk while still having the potential for upsides, a combination of risk-free and risky assets can be chosen.

#### Risk Tolerance vs Risk Capacity

Risk tolerance isn't a great indicator of risk as tolerance changes with the market (up market = high risk tolerance, down market = low risk tolerance).

**Risk Capacity** is the risk somone can take on as still live within their current lifestyle (vs their sustainable living standard).  Having a current lifestyle below one's sustainable living standard is living below or within their means.

The more flexible one can be in future spending, the higher risk they can take on.

### Risk Premium

**Risk Premium** is expected increase in future spending for taking some risk.  It's the return minus the risk-free rate of return (of a risk-free asset).  **It is the expected return above and beyond the risk-free rate of return available on safe assets.**

There is no **expected return** of a risky asset since there is variance in the array of possible returns (volatility).

Some risky assets don't have high potential payouts.  **Informed Market Participants** help pricing reflect the risk of an asset.

> Safe Asset: Expected return of $5 on $100.  5%
> 
> Risky Asset A: 50% chance of $0 return, 50% chance of $15 return on $100.  ((0.5 * 0) + (0.5 * .15))/2 = 7.5%
> 
> Risk Premium of Risky Asset A = 7.5% - 5% = 2.5%

> Risky Asset B: 50% chance of -$10 return, 50% chance of $90 return on $100.
> 
> Minimum Upside Payout: (0.5 * -.10) + (0.5 * x) = 0.075 
  > 
  > = -0.05 + 0.5x = 0.075 
  > 
  > = 0.5x = 0.125 = 25%

So, the upside payout of Risky Asset B would need to be at least $125.


### Risk Preferences

**Risk Tolerance** is the willingness to accept volatility in returns.

**Risk Aversion** is the avoidance of risk, or a low risk tolerance.

A **constant absolute risk aversion** investor is one who holds on to the same percentage of risky assets independent of increases or decreases in wealth.

**Decreasing absolute risk aversion** is the preference to hold on to a higher percentage of risky assets as one's wealth increases.  Thus, wealthier investors tend to have a higher **risk capacity**.

**Modern Portfolio Theory** details that assets with a higher standard deviation of returns (risky assets, like stocks) yield a higher expected return and lower risk assets (e.g. bonds) have a lower return.

High risk tolerant investors prefer to have more assets in stocks that those who are less risk tolerant.

**Prospect Theory** states that investors care about relative wealth and a starting porfolio matters.  This theory assumes that investors are loss averse, so they have a higher sensitivity to losses compared to gains.

**The Certainty Effect** is the preference for investors to lock-in less risky (and thus lower) gains even in the presence of higher risk/higher returns.  Older investors are more suseptible to the certainty effect, and are more likely to seek risk (e.g. gamble) to avoid taking a loss.

### Risk Management

A **Contingent Claims** is a special type of financial assets that pay out when a negative, unexpected event occurs (e.g. homeowner's insurance). The expected payout must be less than the price of the asset.  Contingent Claims (insurance) helps an investor meet their financial goals by avoiding a devastating expense (smooths spending via risk pooling).

An **Insurance Load** is the difference between the premium and the average expected claim.  It is the cost of providing insurance.

#### Risk Retention Decisions

As the cost of insurance increases, expected investor wealth is decreased.  High insurance can outweigh it's utility.

Advisors should **always** consider risk aversion.  An investor's ability to withstand a loss informs the necessity of a contingent claim (insurance).  As investor wealth increases, the less chance that a catastrophic event will impact total wealth.

### Mortality and Longevity Risks

**Mortality Risk** is the possibility of losing human capital through premature death.  The probability is low for someone dying young, making life insurance (contingent claim) for young worker relatively cheap.

Cost of insuring a 46 year old man for 1 year.

**NOTE: Calculation below is important to memorize**

> Probability of dying at 46 is 0.1087% or 0.001087
>
> Assume earnings of $150,000/year (nominal) for the next 20 years, the total value of human capital is 20 * $150,000 = $3,000,000.
>
> Actuarially Fair Price = Value of Human Capital * Probability of Dying
>
> $3,000,000 *  0.001087 = $3,261


Insurance companies charge a fee, called a **load**.  

> Market Premium = (Actuarially Fair Price)/(1 - Insurance Load)
>
> Assuming a 10% load: $3,261/(1 - .1) = $3,623

As workers get older, their chance of dying increases, and the total value of their human capital decreases.  In general, Market Premiums increase as workers get older.

Protecting against mortality risk involves reducing consumption each year by the yearly premium amount (Market Premium).

**Longevity Risk** is the risk of outliving retirement savings.

The median longevity ages is 85 for single US males.  We use a longevity to estimate withdraws from accounts.  There is a 27.8% chance that a single male will live to 90 and a 10% chance that he lives to age 95.

**Annuities** hedge against longevity risk.

### Property, Liability, and LTC Insurance

**Idiosyncratic risk** refers to the risk that an investment will experience a decline in value due to factors that are unique to that particular investment. Contingent claims in property and liability can help mitigate idinsyncratic risks.

As the number of possible negative events occuring (**risk exposure**) increases, insuring for individual events can negatively impact future wealth.  

> Negative return on an insurance policy (**insurance load**) = premium paid - claims paid.

For modest losses, it may be best for the individual to absorb the cost rather than get insurance for it.

#### Rational Decisions about Property and Liability Insurance

How do we make rational decisions about insurance:

1. Identify the most significant loss exposures. Property loss is limited to the price of the property, but liability loss can be unlimited.  Thus, liability risk should be mitigated by insturance.
1. Understand the load of the insurance product.
1. Understand the insurance deductables. **Risk retention limit** is the amount below which the insurer will retain risks.
1. Have emergency funds to cover multiple insurance product deductables in catastrhophic events that affect multiple policies.
1. Wealthier individuals should hold more liquid assets in order to increase risk retention limits.
1. More loss averse individuals will likely want lower deductibles.

**Loss Exposure** is the possibility that a loss can occur.  A distinction exists between *property loss exposure** and **liability loss exposure**.  Property loss happens when propery is actually damaged while liability loss is incurred whenever a claim is submitted since there are significant costs associated with defending a claim.

#### Property Insurance

Property insurance only covers actual loss (aka ***covered peril**).  2 main categories: Real Property (land and anything on the land) and Personal Property (property other than Real Property).

#### Disability Insurance

**Disability risk** increases as individuals get older.  **Long-term disability** is a disability lasting more thn 90 days.

#### Liability Insurance

Liability insurance covers defense costs and claims payouts.  **Compulsary damages** reimburse a claimant who suffered a loss.  **Punitive damages** punishes someone whose conduct causes another to suffer a loss.  Liability insurnace typically covers compulsary damages.

#### Umbrella Liability Insurance

Umbrella Liability Insurance protects against the possibility of losing personal capital and other assets by serving as a barrier between wealth and lawsuits.  It provides high limits of excess liability coverage and broader types of coverage well beyond basic underlying home and auto policies.

The **Self-Insured Retention Limit (SIR Limit)** is a deductible that is required for a policy owner to pay in the event that an underlying policy doesn't cover (aka **Drop-Down Coverage**).

#### Long-Term Care and Wealth Protection

Up to 70% of baby boomers will require Long-Term Care (LTC).  Women have more LTC risks than men.  LTC also affects wealthier individuals more.

##### Approaches to Meeting LTC Risks

The focus should be on an infrequent, but expensive, LTC event.  Larger elimination periods (time before policy kicks in) will be less expensive and transfer catastrophic loos risk to the insurance company.

Medicaid is an option, but has many limitations and requirements that drain capital and may involve inferior services.

##### Types of LTC Policies

* **Single coverage contracts** enable spouses to obtain coverage at different levels.
* **Shared coverage contracts** cover both spouses and unused LTC benefits of a deceased spouse carry over to the living spouse.  These contracts increase the chances of the spouses maximizing benfits.
* **Long-term care partnership programs** protect assets from Medicaid spenddown requirements.
* **Fixed inflationary benefits** protect against currency and medical cost inflation.

##### The Best Time to Purchase LTC Insurance

LTC policies are cheaper when one is younger (policies at 60 are 2x what they are at 50).  Life insurance products offer hybrid policies that add LTC riders.

## Value of Goal-Based Approach

### Elements of Financial Goals

3 main elements to financial goals:

1. Desired future amount
1. Time horizon between the investement and the payout
1. The payout

2 important questions to ask:

1. Are you willing to accept variations in your goal?
1. Are you flexible in your goal amount?

The **trade-off of investment risk** is taking on more risk in order to get higher returns.

Safe investments are easier to estimate than risky ones.  Safe investments estimates are simply made from the current market of low-risk investments (e.g. T Bills).  Risky investments require analyzing historic returns.

### Life-Cycle Goals

The value of goals:

* Matches the investment strategy to the time period of spending goals
* Established objectives for long-term planning
* Reduces client anxiety (avoids **myopic loss aversion**)
* Create opportunities to discuss priorities

Goals are set to focus on long-term strategies, avoiding short-term results emphasis.

By setting goals, we can evaluate progress and adjust accordingly.  They help clients focus on incremental savings by focusing on the overall goal (i.e. keep you eye on the prize).

**Long-term goals can be valuable at motivating short-term actions.**

Goal characteristics:

* Time horizon (increasing a horizon -> riskier asset allocation)
* Flexibility (greater flexibility -> riskier asset allocation)
* Immunization (match the payout of the goal with a bond's duration...safe)
* Prioritization (optimizes resources to focus on the most important goals)

**Unrealistic goals** require discussing tradoffs and flexibility to make them more realistic.  There's a tendency to take on more risk than is desired to meet unrealistic goals, which is not in the best interest of the client.

**Not assuming realistic asset returns will result in a client's inability to make realistic choices about the amount of money needed to save in order to meet goals in the future.**

### Risks and Goals

Asset Risk example:

Risk-Free Portfolio: 1% expected return, 0% standard deviation
Conservative Portfolio: 5% expected return, 7% standard deviation
Aggressive Portfolio: 8% expected return, 15% standard deviation

There is a 13.5% chance it could take longer than 4 years with a conservative portfolio.
There is a 15.6% chance it could take longer than 4 years with an aggressive portfolio.
There is a 1.3% chance it could take longer than 10 years with an aggressive portfolio.

Investment risk **always** adds risk that goals will not be met in volatile markets.

### Liquidity and Goals

**Liquidity** is an aspect of **asset flexibility** that details the degree to which an asset can be converted into cash.

Pure liquid assets: cash and cash equivalents (checking and savings accounts)
Highly liquid assets: stocks and bonds

Stocks and bonds vary in their degree of liquidity.  Stocks and bonds in **shallow markets** (lack of active market of frequent trades) are less liquid that those that are actively traded (deep markets).  Shallow markets force longer sell times and/or lower market sale prices.

Less liquid assets enjoy a **illiquidity premium**, resulting in higher returns to offset the longer sell times.  Illiquid investments include real estate, collectibles, private business assets, and tax-sheltered/tax-deferred accounts.

Illiquid assets have higher transaction costs.  If liquidity is planned in a certain time horizon, investors should prefer more liquid assets.

Having liquidy can be psychologically beneficial for some investors.  Conversely, illiquidity can help some investors "stay the course" as they may avoid the higher transaction costs and lower sale prices.

**The primary risk of using a volatile asset such as a stock mutual fund for liquidity is that the investor may be forced to sell in a down market.**

### Goal Prioritization

Essential goals should be prioritized above non-essential ones.

> Essential Goals > Important and Inflexible Goals > Flexible Goals > Aspirational Goals

Steps in prioritization:

1. Estimate savings needed for each goal
1. Determine time horizon flexibility of each goal
   1. Less time horizon = less risky assets, long time horizon = more risky assets

Goal prioritization helps clients understand the tradeoff of saving more for an essential goal means saving less for lesser goals. 

#### Retirement example:

Assumptions:
* Retire in 15 years
* 3% return on safe assets
* 7% return on risky assets

> Emergency fund ($96,000 in 3 years): inflexible and short time horizon, 100% safe investments

At 3% returns, they need to save $2,550/mo to have $96,000 in 3 years.

> Basic Expenses ($500,000): essential and long time horizon, 70% safe investments, 30% risky

Expected return per year = (0.7 * .03) + (.3 * .07) = 4.2%/year.  That's about $2,000 per month to save $500,000 in 15 years.

> Lifestyle Expenses ($500,000): flexible and long time horizon, 40% safe investments, 60% risky

Expected return per year = (0.4 * .03) + (.6 * .07) = 5.4%/year.  That's about $1,800 per month to save $500,000 in 15 years.
 
> Charity ($500,000): more flexible and long time horizon, 20% safe investments, 80% risky

Expected return per year = (0.2 * .03) + (.8 * .07) = 6.2%/year.  That's about $375 per month to save $500,000 in 15 years. 

**If they can only save $4550/mo, then it's best to save for the emergency fund and retirement basic espenses only for the first 3 years, then use the remaining $2550 to save for lifestyle expenses and charity.**

#### Goals and TVM

TVM (Time Value of Money) helps translate goals into courses of action.  The equation involves estimating a **rate of return**, a **time horizon**, and the **future cost of the goal**.  These assumptions can be modified to evaluate alternatives to achieving the goal.

Example:

> A client needs to save $20,000 in 15 years for college, and already has $500 saved.  Assume a 5% rate of return.

### Social Security Benefits

Established as a baseline income for the elderly. On average, it replace 40% of pre-retirement income.  It makes up 50% of pre-retirement income for 2/3 of all seniors.

TWB = Taxable Wage Base = the maximum wages that are taxed.  It's currently at $125k per year.  Employers and employees pay 6.2%, plus each pay 1.45% for Medicare/Medicaid.  Self employed individuals pay for both sided (double).

The ACA (Affordable Care Act) adds a Medicare surtax of 0.9% for those > $200k (individual) and > $250k (jointly).

OASDHI = Old-Age, Survivors, Disability, and Health Insurance program = Social Security.  

Provides retirement benefits plus disability and families of deceased. 1/6 in the US are in the system (61 million).

90% of US workers contribute to Social Security 

#### Claiming Age

A worker is entitled to receive 100% of thier Primary Insurance Amount (PIA) at their Full Retirement Age (FRA).

Born 1945 - 1954 = 66 FRA
Born 1955 - 1960 = 66 FRA + 2 months per year (e.g. 1955 = 66yrs 2mo, 1956 = 66yrs 4mo)
Born 1096 - now = 67 FRA
Benefit period is from 62 - 70

Claiming at 60:
> 36mo x (5/9 of 1%) = 20%
>
> 24mo x (5/12 of 1%) = 10%
>
> Total reduction = 30% reduction in PIA

Delaying benefits past FRA (capped at 70) increases benefits by 8% per year.  Example:
> 3 years at 8% = 24%
>
> Total increase = 24% increase of PIA

#### Eligilibility

To qualify, a worker must have 40 quarters (10 years) of making $1600 per quarter.

#### Calculating AIME

Average Indexed Monthly Earnings (AIME) characteristics:
* Based on the highest 35 years of income
* < 35 years results in zeros applied to make up the difference
* Yearly capped at the TWB (Taxable Wage Base)
* Earnings up to age 60 are inflation adjusted

#### Calculating PIA

Average Indexed Monthly Earnings (AIME) characteristics:
* 90% of the AIME up to $1000
* An additional 32% of the AIME for $1000 - $5000
* An additional 15% of the AIME for $5000+

The PIA covers more pre-retirement income for lower income individuals than higher ones.

#### Protected Social Security Benefit

The maximum benefit at FRA is currently around $3,600/month ($43k/year).  At 70, this is $4,550/month ($54,600/year).

Calculations aren't necessary if the client can get their online Social Security account.

#### Receiving Benefits

Social Security is a low-risk, inflation protected stream of income.  Deferring at least one claim (for married) often increases the total lifetime benefit.

##### Spousal Benefits

A worker’s spouse is eligible for a spousal benefit (up to 1/2 of the worker’s PIA), subject to 25/36 of 1% per month for the first 36 months and 5/12 of 1% for each additional month PRIOR TO THE FULL RETIREMENT AGE (e.g. 62).

The primary worker must have already started receiving benefits in order for the spouce to clain spousal benfits.

Divorced spouses can claim a benefit if they were married for 10 years or more, and can be initiated even if the primary worker hasn't started receiving benefits as long as both parties are at least 62 years old and divorced for more than 2 years.

##### Survivor Benefits

A surviving spouse can claim the deceased spouses higher benefit.  The benefit amount is determined by the benefit the deceased spouse currently taken.  It's beficial for the higher earning spouse to defer benefits as long as possible to increase the amount of the surviving spouse.

##### Maximizing Benefits

To determine the maximum benefits, perform a net present value analysis.  It's ideal for longevity age to be greater than the break-even age for claming beneits (an incomplete approach b/c of survivor benefits and inflation aren't considered).

Break even ages are typically between 78 - 82.  Loss averse individuals tend to want to claim early, which can reduce overall wealth.

The longer someone expects to live, the later they should claim their benefit (at a max age of 70).

#### Tax Calculation

The taxable amount of social security is:

> (total SS income X 0.5) + other income (modified AGI) + taxable interest

Tax brackets for taxable income (2024):

| Type    | Range           | Tax % |
| ------- | --------------- | ----- |
| Single  | 0 - 24,999      | 0%    |
| Married | 0 - 31,999      | 0%    |
| Single  | 25,000 - 34,000 | 50%   |
| Married | 32,000 - 44,000 | 50%   |
| Single  | 34,001 -        | 85%   |
| Married | 44,001 - 44,000 | 85%   |

#### Social Security Claiming Strategies

Percentage increases by claiming early vs deferring

| Claiming Age | % Increase per year |
| ------------ | ------------------- |
| 62 - 65      | 5%                  |
| 65 - 67      | 6 2/3%              |
| 67 - 70      | 8%                  |

Healthy individuals, high earners and/or married couples benefit more from deferring.

For the average individual, delaying benefits increases wealth.

In order to delay claiming benefits, individuals must have assets to pay for the time between retirement age and social security claiming age (called Bridge Wealth).  Delaying often reduces overall resource needs over the lifteime.

Social Security should be considered to be part of the safe asset allocation in a portfolio.

#### Pensions

Pensions should be considered to be part of the safe asset allocation in a portfolio.  This allows those with pensions to take a greater risk in their invested assets.  Pensions are not inflation protected like Social Security.

## Financial Markets

### Macroeconomics

4 phases of the Business Cycle:
* Trough (Bottom)
* Expansion (Bull Market)
* Peak (Top)
* Contraction (Recession)

#### The Federal Reserve

The primary goals of the Federal Reserve are full employment (low unemployment rate) and price stability (moderate inflation of around 2%).

The Fed has 3 tools:
1. Open market operations
1. Changes in the discount rate
1. Changes in the computation of required reserves

The Federal Funds Rate is the rate banks charge each other (banks with a surples lend to those with deficits).  The Fed has tools to nudge this rate.

##### Monetary Policy

The Fed has 2 main tools for manipulation (**Monetary Policy**):
1. The money supply (M1, the sum of cash in circulation and in checking accounts)
1. Reserve Requirements (The percentage of assets a bank needs to set aside in reserves, usually stored as cash or deposits at the Fed)

**The ultimate goal of monetary policy is to affect the economy through changes in interest rates.**

###### The Money Supply (M1)
To reduce unemployment and increase inflation, the Fed needs to stimulate the economy via open market operations (the purchase and sale of government bonds and mortgage backed securities).  This increases the money supply and increases bank reserves.  The end result should be that banks are more willing to loan money, expanding businesses and increasing the inflation rate.  Expanding businesses should lead to hiring, reducing the unemployment rate.

###### Bank Reserves

The **discount rate** is the rate the Fed charges banks for loans.  Lower rates should stimulate bank loans to businesses.

##### Fiscal Policy

The Fed has 2 tools for Fiscal Policy:
1. Government Spending
1. Taxation

Fiscal policy affects federal debt. Debt can be financed via bonds.  If the Fed sells bonds, it moves cash to buyers.  The Fed buying bonds is a **monetary policy action**, which gives cash to the Fed to increase government spending.

The **Phillips Curve** is the tradeoff between unemployment and the inflation rate.  Decreased unemployment leads to increased wages.  This raises prices and increases inflation.  The Phillips curve is no longer used.

Increases in the money supply lead to higher prices and business expansion, decreasing unemployment.

Stimulating policies are associated with higher stock prices.  Policies that slow economic activity decrease stock prices. Unexpected changes in Monetary and Fiscal policy can lead to sudden and extensive changes in stock prices.  

If the Fed lowers interest rates, reducing expected returns on stocks and bonds, resulting in higher individual savings rates and less ambitious future goals. If the Fed increases interest rates, volatility is increased in stocks and bonds (esp long-term bonds)

The Fed can lower bank reserve requirements, which also has the effect of banks more freely loaning money.

#### Business Cycles

The National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) defines peaks and troughs in business cycles.  There have been 33 business cycles since 1854.  The longest cycle was 128 months, the shortest cycle was 28 months.  The average business cycle lasts about 70 months (6 years). 

The NBER uses 3 indicies to determine where we are in the business cycle:
1. The index of leading indicators (10 indicators including the S & P 500)
1. The index of coincident indicators
1. The index of lagging indicators

When all 3 indicies are rising or falling, it indicates an expansion or contraction/recession.  We get mixed signals when the economy is at a peaks or a trough.

The stock market isn't good at predicting the direction of the economy.

Modern monetary and fiscal policy has gotten better and decreasing contractions and increasing expansions.  The average cycle time from peak to trough (contraction) has decreased from 18% to 11% since 1945. 
The average cycle time from trough to peak (expansion) has increased from 35 months to 58 months since 1945.

Changing business cycles should not affect current allocations of a well-constructed portfolio.  Portfolios should contain a mix stocks and bonds that match the client's risk tolerance and risk capacity.

#### Market Interest Rates and the Effect of Interest Rates

As interest rates increase, all else equal, the value of the assets decreases.

The Fed signals its intention through its public statements, allowing markets to adjust to expansive or restrictive monetary policy. 

The stock market has performed better when the Fed undertakes an expansive policy. Managers should counsel clients to expect lower returns in a restrictive policy and higher ones in an expansive one.

As interest rates rise, the cost of a company's debt capital (borrowing costs) and equity capital (risk preimium) increases.  This decreases business profitability.

As interest rates rise, consumer spending typically decreases (due to the increase in the cost of debt). Higher costs items are more sensitive to increases in interest rates. Lower cost items are less suseptible to changes in interest rates.

Managers want to decrease exposure to durable goods manufactures and increase exposure to energy, consumer goods, and food sectors when interest rates are trending upwards. 

### Inflation

**Inflation** is the change in the price of goods and services over time. 

A **nominal (in name only) amount** does not take inflation into account.  **Real** amounts consider inflation that affect purchasing power of the nominal dollars over time.

**If an investment has a positive nominal rate of return and a negative real rate of return, the purchasing power of the investment will be negative.**


**Real Rate of Return Calculation**
> real rate of return = ((1 + nominal rate of return)/(1 + inflation rate)) - 1

> Earning 2% interest with 4% inflation: (1.02/1.04) - 1 = -1.9%

Risky investments have a better chance of beating inflation than do safe investments over the long term.

#### CPI

Changes in prices of commonly used goods and services (known as a **consumption basket**) over time contribute to the **Consumer Price Index (CPI)**.  The CPI measures how much one can buy at current dollars.

CPI-U (Consumer Price Index of All Urban Consumers) is the broadest consumption basket that represents spending patterns of 87% of Americans.

CPI-W (Consumer Price Index of All Urban Wage Earners) is a subset of the CPI-U that represents spending patterns of 28% of working Americans.  Social Security benefits (SS, disability, survivor) track with the CPI-W (measured from 3rd quarter of the previous year to the 3rd quarter of the succeeding year).

CPI-E (Consumer Price Index for the Elderly) experimentally tracks Americans >= 62 years old, covering 16% of the population.  The CPI-E includes relatively higher housing and medical costs associated with old age.

#### Inflation and Goals

Advisors should consider inflation related to a given goal (e.g. college expenses) rather than than the CPI.

Interest rates are correlated with inflation.  Higher inflation leads to higher interest rates, which leads to higher taxation, which adds drag to investments, which may affect the ability to meet future goals.

Inflation Adjusted Assets (or Inflation Protected Securities) map payouts to inflation rates.  These assets have lower expected real returns since they adjust with inflation and are most attractive to those with the least flexibily goals.

**Infation Risk** is the risk that inflation may affect a goal.

**Consumption Basket** Weights are the weight of groups of expenditures each of the CPI consumption baskets.  They are similar, but CPI-E has double the weight of medical care and 1/2 the weight of education and communication.

#### Long-Term Inflation

The average inflation rate from 1900 - 2020 has been 2.96% with a standard deviation of 4.63%  Over the past 20 years, inflation has decreased to 2.02% with a standard deviation of .95% (not including the recent inflation).

Other than Switzerland and the Netherlands, no other industrialized country has had lower inflation rates from 1900 - 2000.

Over the last 25 years, college inflation averaged 4.2%/year for private schools, and 4.70% for public schools, compared to 2.17% for general inflation.  That twice the level of inflation.

Long term bonds tend to fall with inflation rises, and commodities and high yeild bonds tend to rise with inflation.  Stocks are uncorrelated with inflation and are a hedge against long-term purchasing power due to higher returns.  Therefore, a high seeking portfolio (e.g. stocks) isn't necessarily the same as an inflation hedging portfolio.

### Historical Asset Returns

Historically (and across countries), stocks outperform bonds, and bonds outperform cash.  The higher the risk, the higher the return.

A **histogram** is a chart that shows the frequency of historical annual returns. 

The **equity risk premium** is the premium received from riskier assets (stocks) and is estimated by comparing the return on equities with those of cash (equivelant with short term bonds) or bonds (10 year government bonds).  There is a high risk of investing in equities in the short term (1 year).  Stocks will underperform cash 1/3 of the time in a single year.

**The risk premium based on geometric mean returns versus bonds is about 3.5 percent per year.**

As long as there is any variation in returns, a geometric mean return will always be lower than an arithmetic mean return. Stocks historically provide both higher return and higher standard deviations of returns than bonds, and bonds have provided higher returns and standard deviations of returns than cash.

### Time Diversifiication

**Time Diversifiication** is the notion that time diversifies risk.  In the long term, risky stock assets become less risky.

A **mean reversion** is when returns tend to revert back to their long-run average over time.  Mean reversion is not consistent with efficient market theory or modern portfolio theory.

**Market sentiment** is when prices of stocks go up due to invenstors being optimistic, which lead investors to accept less of a preimium for the same asset.  Conersely, a pessimistic investor in a recession requires a higher premium for investors to purchase the assets.  Market sentiment is one way to explain the existence of bull and bear markets.

**Time diversification is considered controversial because the investment time horizon should not affect the optimal asset allocation for a household.**

### Financial Intermediaries

A **financial intermediary** is an institution that acts as a middleman (or matchmaker) between two parties in order to facilitate a financial transaction.  Financial intermidiaries include banks, credit unions, savings banks, and brokerage houses.

Commercial banks take deposits and make loans.  They are important to the economy as they grease the wheel of commerce.  They also influence monetary policy.

Investment banks take investments and make investments.  Investment banks facilitate the sale of stock to raise money.

Some banks are both commercial and investment banks.  Banks are also classified by size (big vs small).  Big banks are "too big to fail" and small banks engage in "relationship" banking. 

**Shadow banks** are financial intermediaries that are **not** subject to normal regulatory oversight.  They include hedge funds, money market funds, mortgage companies, and payday loan companies.  Shadow banks contributed to the 2007 - 2009 financial crisis.  

**Securitization** is the bundling and selling of assets (e.g. loans).  This allows banks to sell the bundled assets in the marketplace.  This process involves 2 intermediaries: the bank that lends to consumers and the bank that securitizes the loan (shadow bank).

The **Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC)** shares regulatory responsibility over all commercial banks.  FDIC insurance covers $250,000 of deposits in commercial banks.  Because of this, investors should not hold more that $250,000 in a single bank.  The FDIC does not insure against inflation risk.

FDIC insurance leads to lower returns from banks as they provide 100% safe investments.

The federal government provides loan guarantees through the **Small Business Administration (SBA)** which gives banks an incentive to provide loans to small businesses at low risk/low interest rates.

## The Financial Planning Process and Client Behavior

The **client-planner relationship** needs to be established before beginning the financial planning process.  The initial meeting establishes planner responsibilities, the scope of the relationship, and the compensation method.  The goal is to establish trust, define goals, determine individuals that impact the plan, and distinguish the client from non-clients.  The final work product of this initial relationship is the **engagement letter**.

### The 7-Step Financial Planning Process

1. Understanding the Client's Personal and Financial Circumstances
1. Identifying and Selecting Goals
1. Analyzing the Client’s Current Course of Action and Potential Course(s) of Action
1. Developing the Financial Planning Recommendations
1. Presenting the Financial Planning Recommendation(s)
1. Implementing the Financial Planning Recommendations
1. Monitoring Progress and Updating

#### Understanding the Client's Personal and Financial Circumstances
Advisors gather qualatative and quantitative personal and financial data from clients.

#### Identifying and Selecting Goals
Advisors help clients explore goals, as well explain how goals impact each other.  
Upon goal selection, advisors help clients prioritize their goals.

#### Analyzing the Client’s Current Course of Action and Potential Course(s) of Action
Advisors analyze and evaluate the client's current financial state and course of actions (investments).
Advisors goal feasibility and offer alternatives and discusses their advantages and disadvantages.
Advisors evaluate risks to goals as well as personal and finacial circumstances that can impact goals.

#### Developing the Financial Planning Recommendations
Advisors then develop recommendations, including alternative strategies. Assumptions and estimates used in developing recommendations need to be evaluated as well as timing and prioritization of the recommendations. 
Advisors may also consult with outside experts.

#### Presenting the Financial Planning Recommendation(s)
Advisors present their recommendations to the client and ensure the client fully understands them.
Direct and indirect consequenses also need to be relayed.
This process may be iterative.
The final work product of this step is the financial plan.

#### Implementing the Financial Planning Recommendations
Advisors implement the financial plan with varying degrees of participation from the client.
Lawyers and estate planners may also be included in the implementation.

#### Monitoring Progress and Updating
Advisors monitor the progress of the financial plan and associated goals.
Financial plans may need to be updated to reflect new goals and/or changing financial conditions.
Updates will involve moving back to earlier stages in the financial planning process.

### Organizing Client Information

**Internal data** is data specific to the client gathered by questionnaires, interviews, and conversations. Internal data is comprised of both quantitative and qualitative elements.  The individual's microeconomics.

Qualitative Elements: Goals, Values, Risk tolerance, Psychology

Quantitative Elements: Current income, Expected future income, Family member ages, Value of assets and debts

**External data** is  the economic, political, legal, sociological, and technological data and how they affect the client's goals.  The individual's macroeconomics.

External data points include:

* Gift and estate taxes
* Investment returns
* Inflation, interest rates
* Stage of the business cycle
* Housing and job markets
* Local cost of living
* Local insurance costs
* Other pending legislation

#### Quantitative Data

Quantitative data is objective and is verifiable and without bias or error.

**Family Information**

* Names, ages, and health of family members
* Education levels of family members

**Financial Information**

* Annual income of the family members
* Annual expenses of the family members
* Insurance policies owned by the family members
* Bank account and investment account statements of all family members
* Retirement account balances and Social Security statements of all family members
* Government benefits
* Personal financial statements (client or CPA prepared)

**Legal Information**
* Estate planning documents
* Business Documents
* Special Circumstances

#### Qualitative Data

Qualitative data is observable, descriptive data that involves the client's attitudes and beliefs as well as risk tolerance.

* Education Goals
* Retirement Goals
Travel, pick up new hobbies, relax, spend time with family
* Employment Goals
* Savings Goals
* Charitable Goals
* Spending vs Savings Attitude
* Risk Tolerance

#### Financial Statements

**Financial statements** can be broken into 2 categories: (1) the flow of money (e.g. mortgage, loan) or (2) the stock of money (e.g. savings, stocks).

Financial flows are placed in an income and expense report.  Expenses are sorted by fixed and variable expenses.  Fixed expenses are hard to change in the short-run, while variable expenses are easier to change early on.  The income and expesne report is most beneficial for those with difficulties meeting their long-term goals.

A **budget** is a future income and expense statement that aligns the client with their future goals.

A **balance sheet** list all of the client's assets and debts.  Net worth = assets - debts.  Balance sheets also includes intangible assets (e.g. human capital) and project the future value of pensions and social security.  A client can derive utility from tangible assets today and in the future, while intangible assets are primarily for future consumption.  Tangible assets are more illiquid and have higher transaction costs than financial assets.

Since there are penalties from early withdrawl qualified accounts (e.g. 401k), they are separate out from non-qualified (taxable) accounts. 

Liabilities can be broken down into short-term and long-term liabilities. 

The **liqidity ratio** outlines the months a client can exists without income (aka emergency fund).  It's good to have 6 - 12 months of liquid assets on hand.

The **debt-to-income ratio** details the percentage of the client's income that is spent on debt.  Most mortgages require a debt-to-income ratio of 36% or less.

The **savings ratio** (or rate) is the percentage of income that is saved.  Clients are typically able to increase their savings ration as they age.

The **debt-to-asset** ratio measures the overall leverage of a household.  A low ratio can more easily pay down debts.

The **investment asset-to-net worth** ratio is investment assets/net-worth.

### Communication Strategies

* **Credibility**: involves both trust and expertise.  
* **Trust**: the advisor understands the client's needs, offers solid recommendations, and acts in their best interest.  Trust is efficient because it allows clients to deletage expertise to the advisor.
* **Empathy**: the advisor understands the client's feelings and perspective.  Empathy can be improved by asking open-ended questions, paraphrasing, and listening.
* **Mutuality**: both the client and the advisor are both involved in creating the financial plan.  The advisor makes recommendations and the client makes a final decision, which increases the feeling of ownership as well as the liklihood the client will follow the plan.  **Paternalism**, the opposite of mutuality, is when the advisor limits the decsions made by the client, which results in lower client satisfaction.
  
#### Effective Communication

* Reminding the client about market volatility can help build trust.
* Advisors need to confirm the client understands their message.
* Confirm understanding by repeating information received, and asking the client to reiterate what they hear.
* Increase perceived empathy via eye contact, user the client's first name, not interrupring the client, and remembering aspects of the client's life.
* Satisfaction is increased by discussing any future courses of action, and whose is responsibe for each course of action, as well as progress checkin points.

Advisors should arrive at meetings 10 - 15 minutes early, discuss agendas and meeting duration, and end the meeting on time.  Meetings should be strategic and focused.

Being empathic allows advisors to understand the client's values, interests, attitudes, and experiences.  Advisors should not be combative or defensive, nor reveal other client's information.

#### Engagement Letters

An **engagement letter** is a legal agreement between the client and the advisor.  They include:

* Parties involved
* Services provided
* Conflicts of interest
* Fees, costs, and compensation agreements
* Responsibilities of the client and advisor
* Duration of the agreement
* Definition and scope
* Conditions that terminate the agreement

### Investment Policy Statements

An **Investment Policy Statement (IPS)** is a document that details the client's investment portfolio strategy, including risks  The policy is created jointly with the client so that they share in the ownership of the process. The IPS is required for compliance.

Critical aspects of an IPS:

* The client's financial goals and risk tolerance
* An investment strategy that matches these goals and risks
* Strategy implementation via investment selections
* Details of how the plan may change over time
* List of assumptions (e.g. expected returns)
* Permissable asset classes
* Constraints and restrictions
* Investment characteristics and preferences

The IPS should list the investors goals, and each goal should be assigned a:
*  Level of importance
*  Acceptible range of outcomes
*  Time horizon
*  Risk/Return tradoff 

A **Goal-Based IPS** matches investment policy to goals. Goals should be monitored, and the monitoring increased as the goal approaches.  Monitoring criteria can adjust portfolio allocations.  The IPS should be reviewed periodically, especially when life circumstances change.

### Role of an Advisor

Trusted Advisors: ?

**Robo Advisors** have caused some disturbances among advisors, though they don't take into account all of the factors advisors explore in creating a financial plan.

Lots of compensatoin options for consumers: AUM, hourly fees, subscription fees, retainer fee models.

Traditional advisors started off selling insurance or investments, while the trend is degree-based advisors with much more education.

**The Great Convergence** is moving away from products and converging on advice from a single individual/channel that recommends products as needed.

Designations are becomming increasingly popular for advisors.

### Behavioral Finance

**Heuristics** drive choice of wealth managers and investment options.

**Bounded Rationality** explains why people don't always behave rationally when making personal financial decitions.  People make the best choices given their imperfect and limited tools and resources.  In order to mitigate this imperfection, consumers can lean on wealth managers and financial plans to help make rational decisions.

#### Neuroecomonics

**Neuroecomonics** relates the functions of our brain to economic and financial decisions.  Receiving money is considered a **secondary motivator** since we don't immediately or directly benefit from the money, though it can be used to purchase primary motivators (e.g. food).

Paying for things activates parts of the brain that responds to physical pain or it's anticipation.

The **cerebral cortex** is responsible for most information processing.  It's the outside of the brain.  It's divided into 4 main lobes: occipital lobe (visual), temporal lobe (auditory and speech), pariental lobe (focused attention, decision making), and frontal lobe (prefrontal cortex, planning).

The **limbic system** is under the cerebral cortex, residing in the center of the brain.  It's where emotion is processed and memories are formed. 

**System 1** thinking is related to instinctive responses and is driven by emotion.  It's a fast response and is mistake prone since it doesn't run through the frontal cortex.

**System 2** thinking is slower and more deliberate, focusing on reasoning.  This system is more accurate.  This system typically responds when System 1 is incapable to respond.

##### Short-Run Self and Long-Run Self

Also known as the "doer" (short-run or current self) and the "planner" (long-run or future self).  We tend to be more connected to the current/short-run self, viewing our future self as someone else entirely.

##### Rider on an Elephant

The elephant is System 1, and the Rider is System 2 thinking.  The rider does more thinking and is more suseptible to fatigue, and is also more prone to over-confidence.  The rider has illusion of control, but the quick responses of the elephant overcome the rider.

#### A Framework for How We Make Decisions

A way to mitigate irrational/emotional decisions is to rebalance when market conditions change.  Penalitis in tax advantaged accounts also helps think in the long-term.

Emotions lead investors that don't directly follow financial models, making it harder to reach financial goals. 

The emotional response that investors have toward recent losses leads to loss aversion.  Poor desicions: selling stocks when they are down and moving them to cash, firing your financial advisor.  Building trust with clients can help avoid emotional decisions.

Workers close to retirement have a stronger emotional effect. They are more likely to take risk in an "up market" and more likely to avoid risk in a "down market".  This is known as **time-varying risk tolerance**.

Investors lose as much as 1.5% in performance due to market timing.

Advisors should advise clients to only trade a small portion of their porfolio in individual stocks.  This is called the **core satellite approach**.  This is a good way to manage emotiona decision making.

#### Loss Aversion and Prospect Theory

**Prospect Theory** was developed by Daniel Kahneman & Am0s Tversky and relates to loss aversion.  2 aspects:
1. Many of our decisions are based on an arbitrary reference point (purchase price), like overly considering the price paid for a stock vs it's actual valuation.
1. Our brains are wired to make comparisons, so we tend to compare options against the purchase price.

Investors tend to avoid realizing a loss.  They may re-purchase at a lower price to give the feeling that they avoided a loss even though the first purchase was a loss.  The most rational decision is to realize a loss and invest in something better.

Loss aversion leads to (all relate to reference points):
* **The Sunk Cost Fallacy**: investing more in a losing asset due to previous investments in the asset.
* **The Endowment Effect**: not wanting to sell an asset once we own it.
* **The Status Quo Bias**: avoiding change that results in a loss when compared to the status quo.
* Holding losing stocks while selling gaining stocks.

#### Cognitive Biases and the Disposition Effect

A **cognitive bias** happens when invests make incorrect conclusions, usually a result of using a heuristic, to make bad decisions.

Looses feel about twice as bad as gains feel good, so we are more motivated to avoid losses than pursue gains.

The **disposition effect** refers to our tendency to prematurely sell assets that have made gains, while holding on to assets that are losing money.

Comparisons with a reference group (anchor) can lead to the bandwagon effect which offers the illusion of reduced risk.

Investors tend to buy assets they are familiar with or that they work for or have a family connection.  They become overconfident in predictions in these cases. The **core and satellite** approach can help here (allowing the client to "play" with 5% of their portfolio).  

**Bucketing** can help reframe risk by placing different portions of the portfolio in separate "mental" accounts (not necessarily physical).  Examples are cash buckets that relate to "when" money will be spent (0 - 2- years).  Intermediate buckets can be setup for 3 - 10 years into the future which contain slightly more risky assets. Long term expense buckets can be setup for 11+ years and are high risk.  Income earned from the second bucket can fill the first cash bucket.  Bucketing is mostly a behavioral technique and doesn't change the actual portfolio allocations and can achieve higher returns by encouraging investors to maintain an asset allocation over time.

**Psychological Distancing** is how far away something "feels", which affects the way we interpret the imporance and value of things. 4 dimensions of psychological distancing: space, time, social and hypothetical.  Things are less important the further away (space, time, social, distance) they are from us.  Retirement can be thought of as something that is far away.  We consider more details (less abstract) when events are "closer".  Visualizing retirement can be used by advisors to help investors give more importance to far-away events.

Getting clients to talk to advisors about their "financial story" can help the advisor faciliatate a healthy money relationship.  Talking about money is considered by most to be a "taboo".   Stories about money can lead to core beliefs about money.

### Behavioral Modification Strategies

The **Dual Self Theory** is the same as **System 2 Thinking**.  The **functional aspect of money** is objective and the **perceptual aspect of money** is subjective.  Advisors work with the client's more rational brains (thinking slow), but they must understand their emotional brains to help them stay on course.

**Extrinsic** and **intrinsic* motivation plays a role in money.  While intrinsic motivation is more long lasting, advisor must use both type of motivations on clients.  An advisor can extrinsically motive (phone call, reminders, etc.) a client into making a more intrinsic decision (saving for retirement).

**Psychoanalytic theory**, from Freud, states that people motivated by pleasure and avoid pain.  Understand what the client perceives as pleasurable and painful can help advisors properly motivate them.

Advisors can leverage **prospect theory** to make goal-related activities a habbit as the habbit will become the **status quo**.  The **endowment effect** can be leverage by letting clients feel ownership of their goals. **Loss aversion** can be leveraged by adding/removing losses to encourage/discourage behaviors.

#### Vision, Values, & Velocity

**Vision**: advisors can help clients have a clear vision of their future goals.  Advisors can appeal to client's emotions to add to this vision.

***Values**: understanging a client's values can help advisors pick the right tools to motivate client action.  Aligning financial strategies with values can help clients achieve their goals.

**Velocity**: the engagement in a goal (actually moving toward achieving goals).  Advisors can help create velocity by engaging extrinsically motivated clients with goals and behaviors and intrinsically motivated clients with reassurance (**self-efficacy**).  It can also help velocity by breaking lont-term goals into smaller chunks.
