# WMCP360: Introduction to Goal-Based Planning

## Lifetime Role of Wealth

### Life-Cycle Theory

Developed by Nobel prize–winning economist Franco Modigliani (and later with Albert Ando), Life-Cycle Theory aims to maintain a consistent lifestyle throughout one's life via strategies in planning and saving.

#### Utility Theory

Utility Theory details how investors should allocate money over their life once they determine how much income they’ll earn in the future.  Utility is derived by using money to purchase goods and services.

Marginal utility is the utility gained by an addition of money (e.g. one dollar).  Utility theory can be viewed as decreasing marginal utility of consumption.  That is, we get deminishing returns in utility as we increase wealth or income over a certain threshold.

### Consumption Smoothing

Consumption smoothing is the equal division of money for consumption over the estimated remaining years of life.

The earning path is the rise in income over time as well as the large redeuction that happens at retirement.

#### Planning Horizon

The planning horizon is the estimated length of time for a financial plan (life expenctancy).  Life expectancy is just an estimate derived from using Life Tables that match the individual's demographic.

The life expectancy for a newborn male is 76 and 81 years for a female.  
If a male or female is alive at 65, they can expect to live 18 and 20 more years respectively.
Higher-income individuals live an average of 4 years more than the average American, while lower-income live an average of 4 years less than the average American.  The gap between higher and lower income individuals averages 8 years.

Joint mortality is the probability that one spouse will be alive after a given age.

The appropriate retirement planning horizon for most 65 year old individuals is 30 - 35 years.

### Utility Maximization

Utility Maximization looks to maximize the happiness of each dollar spent rather than soley focusing on wealth maximization.  There are diminishing returns in utility as individuals accumulate wealth beyond a threshold.

Humans don't like risk and prefer security, though risk is tolerated if a reward is involved.

### Income Volatility

Human capital is a person's ability to be productive (i.e. earn income).  Human capital is affected by risks in market forces (variable job supply and compensation) or health (accidents/illnesses).  Saving is a buffer that can help smooth volatility.
