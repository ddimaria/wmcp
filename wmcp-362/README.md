## Tax Strategies

### Federal Income Tax Strategies

* Personal income tax is progressive, meaning the tax rate increases (in brackets) as income increases.
* Gross income is the total income before any deductions.
* Capital gains tax is the tax on the profit from the sale of an asset and are progressively taxed at lower rates than ordinary income.

4 principal types of tax planning strategies:

1. Deferring income to future, lower tax years and accelerating income to lower tax years
1. Shifting income to other tax payers in lower tax brackets
1. Accelerating deductions
1. Converting income into capital gains

Due to the time value of money, a dollar of tax paid in the future has less present value than a dollar of tax paid today.  Discount future tax liabilities to determine present value in order to compare tax strategies.

Tax deferral can be profitable even with higher future rates if investment returns outweigh the rate difference.

#### Analyzing Federal Tax Returns

It's benefical to analyze 2 - 3 years of a client's tax returns to understand trends and outliers.

Understanging implications of investetments and portfolio decisions is key to minimizing tax liability, which may include working with the client's CPA.

The marginal tax rate is the tax rate on the last dollar of income.  Knowing this rate is important for tax planning decisions  because it determines the tax impact of additional income or deductions.

> Marginal Tax Rate = (Tax Owned on Additional Income) / (Additional Income)

The Effective Tax Rate is the tax rate on the total taxable income, which is total tax owed divided by total income.  This rate is important for understanding the overall tax burden and comparing tax rates across different income levels.

 > Effective Tax Rate = (Total Tax Owed) / (Total Income)

Increasing a client's AGI can increase their tax liability.

In addition to tax returns, managers should review account statements and tax planning documents to understand the client's financial situation and goals.

#### Income Shifting

Income shifting is the practice of transferring income from high-tax payers to low-tax payers within the same household to reduce the overall tax liability.  This does not work with passive investments involving children or full time college students due to the "kiddie tax", which taxes children's income at the parents' marginal tax rate at amounts greater than $2,600.

#### Capital Gains

Capital gains are typically taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.  Capital gains are calculated as the difference between the **amount realized** (sale price) and the **adjusted basis** of an asset.  The adjusted basis is the original purchase price plus any capital improvements minus depreciation.

A **capital asset** is any property held for investment or used in a trade or business.  This includes stocks, bonds, real estate, and other assets.  They exclude accounts receivable and inventory.  Capital assets held for more than one year are considered long-term and taxed at the long-term capital gains rate (progressive tax brackets of 0%, 15%, or 20%), while those held for less than one year are considered short-term and taxed at the ordinary income tax rate.  Other capital assets include collectibles and certain business assets and are taxed at rate no higher than 28%.

Capital gains rates on **§ 1231 assets** (real property used in a trade or business) are taxed at the same rates as long-term capital gains.  § 1231 assets can be broken down into 2 categories:

1. § 1245 property: personal property or machinery used in a trade or business
1. § 1250 property: non-depreciable business real estate

Losses in both categories are netted against § 1231 gains, and any remaining losses are treated as ordinary losses that offset ordinary income.

§ 1245 property gains up to the amount of depreciation taken on the property are taxed at 20%, while gains in excess of depreciation are taxed at § 1231 rates (long-term capital gains rate).

§ 1250 property gains up to the amount of depreciation taken on the property are taxed at 25%, while gains in excess of depreciation are taxed at § 1231 rates (long-term capital gains rate).

Example 1: Sale of an apartment (§ 1250 property) for $1,350,000, purchased a year ago for $1,000,000, and depreciation taken was $950,000.

> Adjusted basis = $1,000,000 - $950,000 = $50,000
> Gain = $1,350,000 - $50,000 = $1,300,000
>
> The $350,000 appreciation is taxed at 20% = $70,000
> The remaining $950,000 is taxed at 25% = $237,500
> Total tax = $70,000 + $237,500 = $307,500

Example 2: Sale of a  § 1245 property for $1,350,000, purchased a year ago for $1,000,000, and depreciation taken was $950,000.

> Adjusted basis = $1,000,000 - $950,000 = $50,000
> Gain = $1,350,000 - $50,000 = $1,300,000
>
> The $350,000 appreciation is taxed at 15% = $52,500
> The remaining $950,000 is taxed at ordinary income tax rate (for a 37% bracket) = $351,500
> Total tax = $52,500 + $351,500 = $404,000

Capital gains appear on **Schedule D** of the tax return.  The **capital-loss carryover** is used to offset capital gains in future years (like for roth conversions).  **Capital-gain distributions** from investments (e.g. mutual funds) are passed along to shareholders.

Converting ordinary income to capital gains is a primary tax planning strategy for high income clients. One techique is recieving compensation in the form of equity, stock options, and restricted stock.  Another strategy is to hold onto assets for at least a year.  A client can also convert interest income to qualified dividends, which are taxed at lower rates.

Qualified dividends are paid out as earnings are taxed as ordinary income, but are taxed as capital gains.

Losses on sales of capital assets can be used to offset capital gains in the same tax year, but only up to the amount of the gains.  An additional $3,000 can be used to offset adjusted gross income.  Any remaining losses can be used to offset capital gains in future years or ordinary income.

**The Wash sale rule** states that if a capital asset is sold for a loss and within 30 days before or after the sale, the same asset is repurchased, then the loss is not allowed.  This rule is used to prevent taxpayers from selling assets at a loss and then immediately repurchasing the same asset to avoid recognizing the loss.  This applies to all accounts held by the taxpayer, as well as their spouse's accounts.  A way around this rule is to purchase a similar, but not identical, asset.

For tax planning, it's important to understand the 3 different types of tax rates:

1. **The marginal tax rate**: the tax rate on the last dollar of income.
1. **The average tax rate**: the total tax owed divided by total income.
1. **The effective tax rate**: the tax rate on the total taxable income.

#### How Investments Impact Income

1. Capital-gains tax: capital gains rates increase as income increase
1. Alternative minimum tax (AMT): a separate tax calculation that may apply to certain taxpayers, particularly those with complex financial situations.  Higher income taxpayers may want to accelerate income to go from the 37% bracket to the 28% AMT rate.
1. State Income Tax Brackets: vary by state and are generally increased as income increases.
1. Itemized deductions: some deductions are phased out for higher income taxpayers.
1. Net investment income tax: applies to investment income if AGI/MAGI is over $200,000 for singles ($250,000 for married couples).  IRA income above the threshold can make capital gains subject to this tax.
1. IRMAA (Initial Retirement Monthly Amount): based on 4 different thresholds of MAGI that involves adding back tax-exempt interest back to AGI.
1. Roth IRA conversion: increases AGI and may trigger tax at the marginal tax rate on conversion income.  It may be beneficial to convert IRAs to Roth before RMDs begin.  Conversions are best done in a year when the client is in a lower tax bracket.
1. Charitable contributions: QCD (qualified charitable distribution) from IRA accounts are not included in AGI, but count toward the RMD requirement.

#### Tax Loss Harvesting

Tax loss harvesting is the practice of selling assets at a loss to offset capital gains and reduce taxable income.

Order of losses applied to gains:

1. Long-term capital losses offset long-term capital gains first, then short-term capital gains
1. Then short-term capital losses offset short-term capital gains
1. Additional losses can be used to offset up to $3,000 of taxable income
1. Any remaining losses can be carried forward to future years

Benefits of tax loss harvesting:

1. **Net Benefit Returns**: estimated net benefit returns range from 25 to 50 basis points per year.
2. **Increasing Tax Sheltering**: reduce taxes during high tax bracket years, pay taxes on the gains in low tax bracket years
3. **Reduce Tax Burdens Today**
4. **Enable Investors to Avoid Taxes**

Tax loss harvesting works best when assets are purchased in multiple lots over time, where the basis of each lot is known.  Tax loss harvesting can also be done in conjunction with rebalancing the portfolio to optimize tax efficiency.

Investors in the 0% tax bracket should not harvest losses because they do not need to reduce taxes.  These investors should consider harvesting gains instead.

#### Tax Gain Harvesting

Tax gain harvesting is the practice of selling assets at a gain to offset capital losses and reduce taxable income. Investors in low income tax brackets should consider harvesting gains.  The wash sale rule does not apply to tax gain harvesting.

#### Qualified Business Income Deduction

The qualified business income deduction allows business owners to deduct 20% of their qualified business income from their taxable income.  This deduction is available for individuals, estates, and trusts.  The deduction starts to phase out for taxpayers with MAGI over $191,000 for singles and $383,000 for married couples, and is fully phased out for taxpayers with MAGI over $241,000 for singles and $483,000 for married couples.  The deduction is also phased out for **Specified Service Businesses**.

### Taxation of Social Security

Since 1984, Social Security benefits are generally taxable for high income taxpayers.  If Social Security benefits are claimed before full retirement age, up to 50% of benefits may be taxable above the $22,000 threshold.

**Provisional Income** is used to determine if Social Security benefits are taxable.  It is the sum of MAGI + tax-exempt interest + half of Social Security benefits.  If provisional income is less than $25,000 for singles or $32,000 for married couples, then benefits are not taxed.  If provisional income is between $25,000 and $34,000 for singles or $32,000 and $44,000 for married couples, then up to 50% of benefits may be taxable.  If provisional income is greater than $34,000 for singles or $44,000 for married couples, then up to 85% of benefits may be taxable.

The **tax torpedo** may occur if RMDs cause additional dollars of Social Security benefits to be taxable.  An additional dollar of income can cause multiple taxes to be paid.

### Alternative Minimum Tax

The alternative minimum tax (AMT) is a separate and parallel tax system that may apply to certain taxpayers, particularly those with complex financial situations.  Under the AMT, taxpayers are disallowed certain deductions and credits that are allowed under the regular tax system.  Higher income taxpayers may want to accelerate income to go from the 37% bracket to the 28% AMT rate.

To calculate AMT, the taxpayer's income is compared to the AMT exemption amount.  If the taxpayer's income is less than the exemption amount, then the taxpayer is not subject to AMT.  The exemption amount is adjusted for inflation and is currently $75,900 for single filers and $114,600 for married couples.

The AMT is calculated using a 26% flat tax rate on the taxpayer's positive AMT income of $232,600 or less.  The tax rate is 28% for AMT income above $232,600.  The AMT income is the taxpayer's taxable income plus the AMT adjustments minus the AMT exemption amount.  The AMT is then compared to the regular tax liability to determine the amount of tax owed.  If the AMT is greater than the regular tax liability, then the taxpayer is subject to AMT.

The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 made the exemption amount increase and the AMT rate was decreased.  However, the exemption amount is scheduled to expire after 2025.  

5 rules for coping with AMT:

1. **Manage deductions**: Prepay state and local taxes in years when the AMT is not expected to be owed.
1. **Manage inclusion of income**: Accelerate income when the AMT is expected to be owed and when the AMT is lower than the regular tax rate.
1. **Manage realization of capital gains**: Avoid realizing excessive capital gains that trigger the AMT.
1. **Charitable contributions**: Avoid making charitable contributions in years when the AMT is expected to be owed.
1. **Roth conversion planning and Exercising stock options**: Convert IRAs to Roth and exercise stock options in years when the AMT is expected to be owed.

### Estate and Inheritance Taxes

The estate and gift tax systems are interralated/unified in that they share the same tax table and one exemption amount per taxpayer.  The exemption amount has waivered from $5 million to 13 million and is indexed for inflation.  The estate and gift tax is 40% on amounts above the exemption amount.  The estate tax is paid from the estate and the gift tax is paid by the donor.  The "unified credit" is the tax that would have been paid on the federal exemption amount, which is 40% of the exemption amount.

Example: A client has $40 million, who does a charitable contribution of $10 million.  The federal tax exemption is $10 million.

> Taxable estate = $40 million - $10 million = $30 million
> Tax on $30 million = $30 million * 40% = $12 million
> Unified credit = $10 million * 40% = $4 million
> Tax on taxable estate = $12 million - $4 million = $8 million

Tax-free gifts and inheritances are not subject to the estate tax.  There is a $18,000 annual gift tax exclusion per individual.  Medical and tuition expenses (called "qualified gifts") are excluded as long as the donor is alive.

A **qualified personal residence trust** (QPRT) is a trust that allows the grantor to retain a life estate in the property and transfer the remainder interest to the trust beneficiaries.  The grantor can live in the property for a term of years and then the property is transferred to the beneficiaries tax-free.  The duration of a QPRT should end well before the grantor's life expectancy, otherwise the property will be subject to estate tax at the grantor's death.

#### Impact of the Wealth Transfer Tax System

**Portability** means if a spouse dies, the deceased spouse's unused exemption amount is added to the surviving spouse's exemption amount (Form 706 must be filed).  A married couple could shelter $26 million from federal wealth transfer taxes.  Exemption amounts are set to phase out in 2025 (50% reduction).

Life insurance are included in the gross estate for estate tax purposes, even if the policy was transferred within 3 years of death.

#### Gifting

Making lifetime gifts is one of the most effective ways to trasnfer wealth since it can avoid estate, wealth transfer, and gift tax.


The **Federal Gift Tax** is a tax on the transfer of property over one's lifetime.  A **direct gift** is a transfer of property from one individual to another without an intermediary.  A **indirect gift** is a transfer of property through an intermediary, such as a trust or corporation or making payments to the donee's bills.  The tax is calculated at the time of the transfer, and is only imposed if the transfer is completed, though the donee may not receive the property until a later date (e.g. a trust).  Gifting to trusts is a common way to avoid gift tax.

Form 709 is required to be filed if a taxable gift is made.

Exclusions:
* Annual gift tax exclusion: can be applied to each donee (e.g. spouse), called **gift splitting**.  529 plan contributions can be made at 5x the exclusion amount.
* Qualified gifts: tuition or medical expenses and must be paid directly to the institution or provider.

Deductions:
* Marital deduction: a gift to a spouse is deductible and is unlimited.
* Charitable deduction: a gift to a qualified charity is deductible.

Taxable gifts and taxable estate transfers are combined to determine the **unified credit** which can be applied against taxable gifts and estate transfers.  The unified credit is the amount of tax that would have been paid on the federal exemption amount.  The gift and estate tax is progressive, capping out at the highest marginal tax rate or 40%.


Donors should file returns even when the taxable status is uncertain since donee receives a 3 year statute of limitations on the IRS examining the gift.

When gifting real estate, it's best to do it with property with high appreciation potential.  If the property has appreciated, then it's best to donate after death so that the donee can receive a step-up in basis, otherwise the donee will be subject to capital gains tax on the appreciation.  For losses, it's best to do it before death so that the donor can take a loss on the sale of the property since the loss doesn't transfer to the donee after death.  Gifting property that is secured by a loan can cause tax problems for the donor.

#### Death and Taxes

The federal estate tax applies to only the top 1/2 of 1% of people.  The exemption shelteres $11 million for singles and $22 million for married couples (indexed for inflation).  Issues concerning property situs and domicile are important to consider when planning for estate tax after death.

States vary in their estate tax laws, though less than 1/2 of states have their own estate tax.  The state of domicile dictates probate laws and estate tax laws.

To prevent issues with state estate tax:
* Identify the situs and titling of all the client's assets.
* Determine the applicable state inheritance and estate tax laws.
* Continue to monitor the client's asset holdings.

## Tax Sheltering

Tax sheltering is the practice of reducing taxable income by taking advantage of tax-favored investments and strategies.  Individuals with a high marginal tax rate benefit the most from tax sheltering.

Realized gains and losses are taxed at the ordinary income tax rate if held for less than a year and at the capital gains tax rate if held for more than a year.  Unrealized gains and losses are not taxed and are a form of tax sheltering if client's sell the asset in a year of a lower tax rate than the year the asset was purchased.  

Tax sheltered accounts can help client's avoid withthdrawls since they are earmarked for specific purposes and have a 10% penalty for early withdrawals (like a lock box).  There are also pshcyholgical costs to withdrawing from tax sheltered accounts.  In behavioral finance theory, the lock box is a **commitment device** that helps the client avoid withdrawing from the account.  Realizing gains in a tax sheltered account does not create a taxable event.

Tax sheltering risks include:
* Senstitive to tax law changes
* Sensitive to changing income tax rates
* Sensitive to income and filing status

Tax sheltering benefits include:
* Creates a lock box
* Gives control over tax liability
* Moves tax burden to future years when tax rates are lower
* Having lower losses due to tax increases goal success

Types of tax sheltered accounts:
* Tax-deferred accounts (tax is deferred until withdrawal): 401(k), IRA, 403(b), 457(b)
* Tax-exempt accounts (tax is paid ahead of time): Roth IRA, Roth 401(k), Roth 403(b), Roth 457(b)
* HSA (health savings account): tax-free contributions and withdrawals, tax-deferred earnings, tax-free withdrawals for qualified medical expenses
* Real estate: increase in value is unrealized, and an exemption applies to the gain when the property is sold
* Private business assets: appreciation is deferred until the asset is sold
* Taxable accounts: tax is paid on realized gains and losses
* Cash-value life insurance and annuities: tax-deferred growth, tax-free withdrawals for qualified medical expenses

Mutual funds and ETFs are not tax sheltered since they are **pass-through entities**.  The income is taxed at the investor's marginal tax rate.

Investments held in taxable accounts may have a lower tax rate than tax-deferred accounts in some cases.

### Traditional IRAs

The purpose of IRAs are to encourage savings for retirement with the benefit of tax sheltering.  IRAs target middle class Americans, so they include limitations on contributions.

**Deductible IRA contributions** are made with pre-tax dollars, so the contribution is subtracted from taxable income.  The contribution is tax-deductible and the earnings grow tax-deferred, so taxes are applied at a later date on all proceeds.

**Non-deductible IRA contributions** are made with after-tax dollars, so the contribution is added to taxable income.  The contribution is not tax-deductible but the growth is tax-deferred, so taxes are applied at a later date on the groth only.

Traditional IRAs boost net returns over a taxable account, even if the client is in a higher tax bracket in the future.

Traditional IRA Limitations:
* If the client reaches 70.5 before 2020, then they can only contribute up to 70.5.  Otherwise, there are no age limitations.
* The maximum contribution is $7,000 per year, or $8,000 if the client is 50 or older.  These limits are indexed for inflation.
* The individual or couple not covered by an employer can deduct the full contribution amount from their taxable income if their AGI is below a modest threshold.
* They have limited liquidity before age 59.5.  Withdrawals before age 59.5 are subject to a 10% penalty.  Client's cannot take out a loan against the IRA.
* RMDs must be taken starting at age 72.  For investors born between January 1, 1951 and December 31, 1959, RMDs must be taken starting at age 73.  For investors born after January 1, 1960 RMDs must be taken starting at age 75.  RMD penalties of 50% apply if the RMD is not taken.

The 10% penalty can be avoided for:
* Health insurance premiums while unemployed or unreimbursed medical expenses >7.5% of AGI
* Qualified higher education expenses
* Substantially equal periodic payments (SEPP/72(t) distributions)
* First-time home purchase (up to $10,000)
* IRS levy
* Military reservist called to active duty (>179 days)
* New parent through birth/adoption (up to $5,000 per child, per spouse)

Secure Act 2.0 Penalty-Free Withdrawal Provisions:
* Domestic Abuse (2024): Up to $10,000 or 50% of vested balance (indexed for inflation)
* Terminal Illness: Full withdrawal if certified life expectancy is 84 months or less
* Emergency Needs (2024): One $1,000 withdrawal per year for immediate financial emergencies
* Natural Disasters: Up to $22,000 lifetime for federally declared disaster areas (retroactive to Jan 2021)
* Long-Term Care (2026): Lesser of 10% vested balance or $2,500 annually (indexed for inflation)

A traditional IRA is ideal when the tax rate at contribution age is higher than the tax rate at withdrawal age. This is expecially true for high income clients.  Roth IRAs should be considered if tax rates in the future are higher than the current tax rate.

### Roth IRAs

In Roth IRAs, contributions are made with after-tax dollars, and the growth and qualified distributions are tax-exempt. 

Qualified distributions include:
* Withdrawals after age 59.5 after a 5 year holding period
* Withdrawals made to heirs after the death of the account owner
* After permanent and total disability
* Certain first-time home buying expenses
* Non-qualified distributions are taxed as ordinary income and might be subject to the 10% penalty if the account owner is under 59.5.

Roth IRA benefits:
* Exempt from Income tax
* Higher net rates of return over taxable accounts
* Unaffected by income tax rates
* Investors can reduce taxes and increase retirement spending by strategically drawing from a Roth IRA
* Can be used to avoid the investment income tax or IRMAA

**Tax diversification** involves holding assets in different types of tax sheltered accounts to adapt to changing tax laws and rates.

Funding a Roth IRA:
* Contributions
* Roth conversions
* Rollover Roth IRA

Roth IRA contribution rules:
* The investor must have taxable income
* A married investor can contribute to their spouse's Roth IRA if the spouse is low to no income and files a joint tax return (Spousal IRA)
* A single person can make a contribution if their MAGI is below $161,000 and a married person can make a contribution if their MAGI is below $240,000
* IRS limits contributions to all IRA accounts
* Contributions can be withdrawn at any time without penalty (but not growth), making them more liquid than traditional IRAs

Roth IRAs are most appropriate for:
* If a taxable account is the only other option
* After the client has taken the 401k match
* Those with low current marginal tax rates
* Pre-retirees that are phasing into retirement
* Those without Roth IRA balances (improves tax diversification)
* For aggressive savors and investors to avoid RMDs
* Investors that have a bequest intent
* Younger investors that are in a lower tax bracket
* If tax rates are expected to be higher in the future

Exeptions to the 10% penalty (though growth is still taxed as ordinary income):
* Substantially equal periodic payments (SEPP/72(t) distributions)
* Qualified higher education expenses
* Unreimbursed medical expenses >7.5% of AGI
* Qualified health insurance premiums
* Qualifited disaster relief distributions (up to $100,000 per disaster)
* Birth or adoption of a child (up to $5,000 per child, per spouse)

The 5 year rule:
* Some Roth account must have been open for 5 years for the growth to be tax-free
  * Planning opportunity: create a Roth IRA asap
* The principal of Roth conversions are subject to the 5 year rule for EACH conversion to be tax-free
  * Irrelevant if the client is older than 59.5

Roth 401(k)s:
* Ideal for high income clients since they don't have income limits
* Other Roth IRA benefits apply

### IRA Strategies

#### Roth Conversions

Roth conversions are the process of converting a traditional IRA or 401(k) to a Roth IRA.  Taxes are paid on the conversion amount at the client's current marginal tax rate.  There are no income limits for Roth conversions, which makes them suitable for high income clients.  It's optimal to invest in traditional IRAs and 401(k)s when a client's marginal tax rate is higher and should convert to Roth IRAs when the client's marginal tax rate is lower.  A 10% penalty applies to early withdrawals from Roth IRAs if the money was converted less than 5 years ago and the client is under 59.5.  Roth conversions improve a client's liquidity and tax diversification.

It's best to pay taxes on the conversion with money from a taxable account rather than from the conversion itself.  Roth conversions outperform taxable accounts in the long run and beat tax-deferred accounts if the funds are subject to RMDs.

Heirs may receive higher inheritted values from a Roth IRA than a traditional IRA.

Optimal situatious for Roth conversions:
* Before RMDs begin and if social security is delayed, fill up lower tax brackets with conversions
* Tax credit carryforwards and charitable deductions can offset the tax on conversions
* Assets with depressed values can be converted to reduce overall tax costs

The net return benefit of a conversion is greatest for funds converted before retirement and spent soon after retirement.

Conversions can be difficult for risk aversse clients.

#### Nondeductible IRAs

A nondeductible IRA is an IRA that is funded with after-tax dollars and is not tax-deductible.  Taxes are deferred on earnings (growth) only, and txed at ordinay income and capital gains rates at the time of withdrawal.   Nondeductible IRAs are inferior to traditional IRAs and Roth IRAs.

Nondeductible IRAs are best for tax inefficient investments (e.g. bonds) and if the client is in a low tax bracket at distribution.  Nondeductible IRAs can be converted to Roth IRAs with a backdoor Roth IRA.  An ideal backdoor Roth IRA conversion is when the client does not have existing traditional IRAs.

After Tax 401(k)s Contributions offers the same benefits as nondeductible IRAs, but the contributions are made with pre-tax dollars.  The contributions (but not the growth) can be use for Roth IRA conversions.

Nondeductible IRA are most appropriate for:
* After the client has maxed out other tax advantaged accounts
* The clieht does not have significant funds in a traditional IRA (because of the pro-rata rule)
* The client is older than 59.5 (for liquidity reasons)
* The client is far from RMDs
* The invested assets are tax inefficient (e.g. bonds)

The pro-rata rule for taxes on IRA distributions treats all IRA accounts as one pool of assets.  The percentage of nondeductible contributions in the pool is used to determine the tax on the distribution (percentage of nondeductible contributions in the pool dictates the percentage of the distribution that is NOT taxed).

Nondeductible IRAs effectiveness depends on:
* The rate of return on the assets
* The current and future tax rates
* The length of the holding period

#### Inherited IRAs

An inherited IRA is a Roth or Traditional IRA that is inherited by a beneficiary.  Non-designated beneficiaries (e.g. charities, trusts, your estate) must take all distributions within 5 years.  Non-Elibible Designated Beneficiaries have to take all distributions within 10 years.  Taking only the RMDs can stretch out the distribution period over their lifetime.  RMDs start when the deceased person would have turned 73.

Centrain individuals (Eligible Designated Beneficiaries) can stretch out the distributions 10 years:

* Spouses (not more than 10 years younger than the deceased)
* Minor children
* Disabled beneficiaries
* Chronically ill beneficiaries

Trusts that meet certain requirements can also be considered Eligible Designated Beneficiaries and are best for:

* Minors
* Adults that aren't capable or responsible enough to handle the money
* Protection from creditor and backruptcy claims
* The deceased has children from a previous marriage

A spouse can roll over the IRA into their own IRA.  If the spouse is less than 59.5, they can setup an inherited IRA.  The spouse has the option to renounce the IRA if they want another beneficiary to inherit the IRA.  If the surviving spouse is older than the deceased, then the surviving spouse can take RMDs when the deceased would have turned 73.

A non-spouse beneficiary can denounce the IRA OR transfer the funds to an inherited IRA.  If the non-spouse beneficiary is older than the deceased, then the surviving spouse can take RMDs when the deceased would have turned 73.

Inherited IRAs best practices for IRA owners:
* Choose a beneficiary that meets estate planning goals
* Name primary and contingent beneficiaries for the most RMD flexibility
* File beneficiary forms regularly
* Limit withdrawals to RMDs

Inherited IRAs best practices for beneficiaries:
* Transfer the IRA to an inherited IRA and name beneficiaries
* For multiple beneficiaries, transfer the IRA into separate accounts by December 31st of the year of the deceased's death
* Determine if the IRA owner took RMDs in the year of the deceased's death
* Limit withdrawals to RMDs
* Take the RMD by December 31st of the each year

The IRD (Individual Retirement Account Deduction) deduction or 691(c) is an income tax deduction in the amount of estate tax paid when inheriting an IRA. 


#### Rollovers

All qualified plans, 403(b) annuities, government-sponsored 457(b) plans, and IRAs can be rolled over into another qualified plan or IRA.  Only a participant can roll over their own qualified plan.  A spouse who is an alternate payee can roll over their own qualified plan.

Distirbutions that are not qualified:
* RMDs
* A hardship withdrawal from a 401(k)
* SEPP (72(t)) distributions
* Dividends from employer stock
* Life insurance within a 401(k)

Most plans allow the participant to elect:
* A lump sum distribution
* A direct rollover to another qualified plan or IRA
* A partial rollover and a partial distribution

Types of rollovers:
* A 60-day rollover: the distribution must be made within 60 days of the distribution date.  After the 60 days, the distribution is subject to a 10% penalty and income tax.  Only 1 60-day rollover is allowed per year.  Some exceptions apply.
* A direct rollover: the distribution is rolled over into another qualified plan or IRA
* A trustee-to-trustee rollover: the distribution is rolled over into another qualified plan or IRA without an intermediary (60-day rules apply)

Distributions from a qualified plan is subject to a mandatory 20% withholding tax unless the distribution is rolled over into another qualified plan.  Traditional IRAs, SEP IRAs, and SIMPLE IRAs are not subject to the 20% withholding tax.  

SIMPLE IRAs rollover rules:
* The distribution must be rolled over into another SIMPLE IRA
* Into a traditional IRA once the SIMPLE IRA has been open for 2 years

In taxable accounts, substitutions aren't allowed.  Only qualified plans allow sale of assets prior to rolling over.

Reasons not to rollover:
* Read the plan documents, as they could have lower investment fees or other benefits over the target IRA
* Some qualified plans have options that aren't available in IRAs
* Some qualified plans have distribution options like annunities that have favorable rates
* It may be tax beneficial to keep the qualified plan, like in the case of the "rule of 55"
* After tax contributions will be subject to RMDs if rolled over
* For employee stock, the net unrealized appreciation strategy avoids ordinary income tax treatment on the growth of the stock
* Life insurance in a qualified plan cannot be rolled over
* Maturing benefits like CDs should not be rolled over until they mature

Reasons to rollover:
* Wider range of investment options
* Consolidate accounts for cost and simplicity
* Improved access to funds
* Rollovers required for QCDs (qualified charitable distributions)

### Tax Sheltering Strategies

4 primary types of investing accounts:
* Annually Taxable accounts: growth is taxed annually typically at the investor's ordinary tax rate.  Includes checking, savings, money market accounts, bond mutual funds and ETFs, REITs, and CDs.
* Basis assets accounts: growth is deferred until the asset is sold typicall at the capital gains tax rate.  Includes stocks, mutual funds, ETFs, life insurance or annuities liquidate before death, and business assets like real estate.  Gains on insurance are subject to the investors ordinary income tax rate.
* Tax-deferred accounts: tax is initially deducted and then deferred until withdrawal.  Includes traditional IRAs, 401(k)s, 403(b)s, and 457(b)s.
* Tax-exempt accounts: purchased with after-tax dollars, growth is tax-exempt.  Includes Roth IRAs and Roth 401(k)s

Calculating After Tax Return:
> After-Tax Return = Pretax Return * (1 − Marginal Tax Rate)

Calcluating Net Return:
> Net Return = Gross Return * (1 − Marginal Tax Rate)

Calculating Future Value:
> Future Value = Gross Return * (1 + After-Tax Return)

**Data to use for all examples:**
```
An investor with $10,000 of gross income who has an income tax rate of 40% for the next 20 years. The investment is held within an annually taxable account with a 4% rate of return for 20 years.
```

**Annually taxable example:**
> Gross Return = $10,000 * (1 - 0.40) = $6,000
> Net Return = (.04 * (1 - 0.40)) = 2.4%
> Future Value = $6,000 * (1 + 0.024)^20 = $9,641.63

**Tax-Exempt example:**
> Gross Return = $10,000 * (1 - 0.40) = $6,000
> Future Value = $6,000 * (1 + 0.04)^20 = $13,146.74 

*Tax-exempt earns $3,505.10 more than annually taxable.*

**Tax-Deferred example:**
> Gross Return = $10,000 * (1 - 0.40) = $6,000
> Future Value = $6,000 * (1 + 0.04)^20 * (1 – 0.40)  = $13,146.74

*Tax-deferred earns the same as tax-exempt when the 40% is the same during earning years and when taking distributions.  This is called the "traditional/Roth equivalency"*

**Tax-Deferred example with 30% marginal tax rate in distribution years:**
> Gross Return = $10,000 * (1 - 0.40) = $6,000
> Future Value = $6,000 * (1 + 0.04)^20 * (1 - 0.30) = $15,324.17 

Calculate the rate of return of the tax-deferred example using the net present value formula:
> Present Value = -$6,000 
> 
> Future Value = $15,324.17 
> 
> Years = 20 
> 
> The above is used to calculate the rate of return.  Rate = 4.80%

#### Basis Assets Accounts

The basis assets accounts grow more than the annually taxable accounts since the growth isn't taxed until the asset is sold.  They also receive a more favorable capital gains tax treatment on the growth.

Investments with high returns should be held longer than low returns.

Selling low diversified assets with high returns is a good way to improve the overall Sharpe Ratio.

Some funds include basis assets and annually taxable assets, which will have a lower return than a basis assets account if they both grow at the same rate.

Annuities and life insurance products liquidate before death have the same tax deferral compounding effect as basis assets accounts, though tye are typically taxed at ordinary tax rates when realized.  If lower tax rates are expected, then insurance products should be allowed to grow during working years and liquidated during retirement.  Insurance products can be used to convert annually taxable assets to basis assets.  Gains from an insurance product can also be converted into an income annuity in order to smooth out the tax burden (exclusion ratio) and still receive tax-deferred growth.

### Asset Location

Asset location is the process of allocating assets to accounts with different tax treatments in order to achieve higher after-tax returns. The 3 basic types of accounts are taxable, tax-deferred, and tax exemption.

**Taxable**:
Provide the lowest net after-tax returns.  Gains are taxed on withdrawals using the capital gains tax rate.  Dividends and interest are typically taxed at the investor's ordinary income tax rate, though they may be considered "qualified" and subject to more favorable tax rates after being held for at least 60 days.  Best for tax-efficient investments with low realized gains.  Bonds and active mutual funds with high turnover are not good in this account.

**Tax-Deferred**:
Provide higher net after-tax returns than taxable accounts.  Gains are deferred until withdrawal and taxed at the investor's ordinary income tax rate.  Best for tax-inefficient investments like high yield bonds and funds/stocks with high turnover or dividends.

2 main types:

* Favorable on Contributions and Growth: but unfavorable on withdrawals, traditional IRAs and 401(k)s
* Favorable on Growth but not Contributions: annuities and non-deductible IRAs

**Tax-Exempt**:
Provide the highest net after-tax returns in many cases.  Contributions are made with after-tax dollars and growth is tax-exempt.  Roth IRAs, Roth 401(k)s, 529 plans, and Coverdell Education Savings Accounts are tax-exempt. Best for tax-efficient investments with high growth and high turnover.

The most accurate way to determin asset location is to consider values across the types of tax treatment, the current and future tax rates of the investor and the time horizon of the investments.  These strategies can change over time, so it's important to reevaluate the asset location periodically.  Asset allocation percentages don't have to be consistent across the account types.

## Funding Client Goals

### Retirement Income Planning and Distribution

Steps of a goal-based retirement income plan:

1. Estimate the lifestyle goal: retirees spend the same the year after retirement as they did the year before retirement.  Estimate using a ratio (like 75% of pre-retirement income) or the more precise breakdown of current and future expenses (retirement savings and payroll taxes don't need to be paid in retirement and will pass less in income tax).
2. Evaluate the flexibility of the income goal: detail flexible and inflexible expenses.  Determine willingness to be able to cut back on flexible expenses if necessary.  Inflexible expenses typically make up 65% of the total expenses.

Social Security and pensions are subtracted from the inflexible spending needs.  The remaining amount should be funded by safe assets (bonds and income annuities).  If the client retires before claiming Social Security, then inflexible spending needs are funded by the client's savings (IRAs, savings).  Most pensions are do not adjust for inflation.

Bond durations should match their funding goals. TIPS and I-Bonds can reduce inflation risk.  Annuities can reduce longevity risk (not typically adjusted for inflation).

Flexible goals can be funded by the client's portfolio, using the 4% rule to estimate the safe withdrawal amount (inflation adjusted over a 30 year period).  A more optimal approach is to use a **Guardrail Strategy** to estimate the safe withdrawal amount (should match the client's spending flexibility).

A variable annuity with a guaranteed lifetime withdrawal benefit (GLWB) is safer than a guardrail strategy, though it has less upside potential.

An investment-only approach requires flexibility in spending since returns are variable.  Bequest money can be used to buffer against volatility.

A client that has under-saved has 3 options:
1. Increase savings rate
2. Adjust retirement goals
3. Adjust retirement date

The ordering of withdrawals across accounts is important for tax efficiency.  Selling assets with the lower expected returns first is often best, though calculating the net return of each asset is more accurate.  Basis assets with a lower capital gains (or loss) should be sold before assets with a higher capital gains.  Annual taxable accounts and basis assets should be sold before Roth IRAs.

Efficient ordering:
* Lowest net return assets: Annual taxable savings, CDs, bonds, REITs and traditional IRAs where the current tax rate is lower than expected future tax rates.
* Moderate net return assets: active management funds, high dividend stocks, efficient basis assets with a low capital gains (or loss), highly appreciated stocks
* Highest net return asset: Roth IRAs, highly efficient basis assets with a high capital gains (or gain), permanent life insurance

Roth Net Return = the gross investment return
Annual Taxable Account Net Return = the gross investment return * (1 - marginal tax rate)
Tax-Deferred Account Net Return = affected by the marginal tax rate at contribution and the marginal tax rate at distribution
Basis Assets Account Net Return = affected by the number of years the asset is held and the tax rate applied to growth, the net return grows as the value of the asset grows relative to the original price

Annuities resemble basis assets.

Tax bracket management: withdrawing from traditional IRAs in order to fill the lower tax bracket prior to RMDs maximizes returns.  The proceeds can be used to pay current expenses or converted to Roth IRAs.

### Education Funding

#### Federal Student Loans

Federal student loans are either need-based or not need-based.  Interest rates are fixed for the life of the loan and a generally lower than private loans.  There are limits on the amount of federal student loans that can be taken out, and they vary by the year that the student is in school.  Federal loans have favorable death and discharge provisions.  The FAFSA (Free Application for Federal Student Aid) is required for all federal loans.

Types of federal student loans:
* Federal Direct Stafford Subsidized Loans: need-based with a very low origination fee
* Federal Direct Stafford Unsubsidized Loans: not need-based with a higher origination fee
* Federal Perkins Loans: need-based with NO origination fee
* Federal Direct Consolidation Loans: not need-based with NO origination fee
* Federal Graduate PLUS Loans: not need-based with a high origination fee
* Federal Parent PLUS Loans: taken out by the parent, not need-based with a high origination fee, borrowing limit equal to the cost of attendance minus other assistance, only requires a credit check

Financial need = Cost of attendance (COA) - Expected family contribution - Resources (assets and income)

The studend loan interest deduction is best taken by the student since they don't exceed the AGI thresholds.

Only the "Income Contingent Repayment Plan" is available to parents, all others income-driven federal load repayment plans are available to the student.  All federal loans default to a 10 year repayment plan, but other plans are available.  Some repayment plans may be eligible for foregiveness (income-based, pay-as-you-earn, revised pay-as-you-earn), and have the lowest monthly payments.

#### Private Student Loans

Private student loans are not need-based and have higher interest rates than federal loans.  They are offered by banks, credit unions, and loan agencies.  They are not eligible for the studend loan interest deduction.  They are not eligible for the death and discharge provisions of federal loans since parents tyically cosign.

Private student loans are best for parents that have funds but lack cash flow to cover education expenses.  Some private loans may have a lower interest rate than the Parent PLUS loan and have much lower origination fees.

* Students can create their own Roth IRAs

**Taxable Investment Account**
* Used for filling the gap when the other options are filled passed their efficiency limits
* Fill up the 529 plan first to the state limits, then use a taxable account for anything extra

Having multiple account types adds diversification, flexibility, tax-efficiency, and return optimization  to the education savings portfolio.

## Estate Planning Goals

### Wealth Transfer Goals

Estate planning challenges:
* Complexity of the process
* Inconsistent information
* Avoidance or procrastination
* Potential for conflict between family members

Prioritized Estate Planning Goals (in order of importance):
1. Adequacy of future income: clients and spouses should have enough to fund their retirement before bequests are made
2. Patterns of distribution: "who", "what", "how" and "when" will heirs receive assets
3. Excessive transfer costs: optimize the estate plan to minimize costs (including wealth transfer tax, estate tax, and probate costs)
4. Estate liquidity: ensure that the estate has enough liquidity to pay for the estate plan

The wealth manager should address the prioritized objectives in the order of importance.  Assets should be liquidated before bequests are made unless the heirs will take over the assets (e.g. family businsess) or the client still needs the cash flow.

A **spendthrift trust** protects  beneficiary from mismanaging their own money by limiting their access to funds and shielding them from creditors.

A **supplemental needs trust** is a trust that is used to provide for the needs of a beneficiary who is disabled or otherwise unable to manage their own affairs.

Philanthropic goals should be considered in the estate plan. 

An **irrevocable life insurance trust or ILIT** is a trust that is used to purchase life insurance on the client's life.

Wealth transfer planning should also include contigencies during the clients lifetime, such as a disability or incapacity.

A **power of attorney** is a document that gives someone the authority to make decisions on behalf of the client (aka Springing Power of Attorney) should the client become incapacitated.

A trust can hold assets and includes provisions.  A trustee is the person who manages the trust, and an alternative trustee manages the trust if the primary trustee is unable to do so.

**Guardianship** is the process of appointing a guardian to manage the estate of a minor or incapacitated adult.

### Estate Plan Preparation

A client's current estate plan should be reviewed by the wealth manager. State intestacy provisions should be reviewed to ensure that the estate plan is consistent with the client's wishes.  A well-designed should avoid unnecessary probate costs and taxes. A common roadblock is the client's poor documentation.

Steps:
1. Deterime the client's wealth at the time of death
2. Do a beneficiary audit.  Minors and disabled heirs cannot be direct beneficiaries. Guardianship should be not be made a beneficiary.
3. Help the client identify and organize financial accounts, property deeds, insurance policies, mortgage information, marital agreements, wills and trusts, and employee benefit records.  This should be done for the spouse as well.  This information should be store in multiple locations.  Records should be consolidated.  Family members should be informed of the location of the records.

Methods of wealth transfer:
* Wills: 70% of americans haven't executed a will.  A will transfer's a client's probabe property (propery the client owns that isn't covered by other mechanisms (e.g. trusts, life insurance, beneficiary designations on accounts)).  The executor of the will is responsible for settling the client's estate.
* Beneficiary designation: Governed by applicable contract or trust law.  Beneficiary designations on accounts override the will and should be reviewed for completeness.  Accounts are Transferred on Death (TOD).
* Survivorship: Jointly titled accounts (property, financial accounts, life insurance, annuities) is transferred to the surviving owner (e.g. spouse).  Overrides the will and beneficiary designation.  Dying with a will or having an invalid will results in the decedent being considered intestate.  Intestacy laws vary by state and applies to the decedent's probate property.
* Trusts: Operation of law transfers assets to the trust.  The terms of the trust determines distribution of assets to beneficiaries.  The trustee is a fiduciary to the trust's benefeciaries and must act in accordance of the terms of the trust, including distribution amounts and timing of distributions.

Non-probate transfers include beneficiary designations on accounts/policies, survivorship accounts, and trusts.  These transfers are not subject to probate and happen without the need for a will.  These transfers happen faster and more efficiently than via a will or probate.  They are also more difficult to challenge in court, and are not easily reachable by creditors.

Probate transfers include assets passed under the will to named heirs, trust assets distributed to a named beneficiary (except testamentary trusts), testamentary trust assets distributed to a named beneficiary, financial accounts paid to named transfer on death or pay on death beneficiaries, assets passed via intestacy statutes, and transfers to a surviving tenant via joint tenancy with right of survivorship or to a spouse via tenancy by the entirety.  Probate courts (aka Orphan's Courts) are the state courts that handle probate.  Executors are appointed. Probate records are publicy accessible.

Divorce rules can vary by state.  A divorce decree may override the will or beneficiary designation.  The divorcing spouse may want estate transfers to be made to the former spouse, especially in cases where the former spouse is the primary caregiver of the children.  Beneficiary designations should be reviewed during a divorce.

A client's wealth could shrink after making a estate plan.  

Red flags when reviewing a client's estate plan:
* Transfers to minors
* Transfers to heirs that cannot properly manage their lump-sum finances
* Transfers to disabled heirs that might qualify for public assistance
* Transfers to the spouse that should go to creating a legacy
* Are assets illiquid
* Is the client subject to state and federal wealth transfer taxes

Transfers to minors are not possible since they can't own assets/property.  Assigning a minor as a beneficiary resutls in courts appointing a guardian, which can be expensive and inefficient.  Trusts should be used to transfer assets to minors.  Some states require UGMA/UTMA accounts for transfers to minors.  Guardians are named in the will or trust, though less efficient than a trust as guardians are superfixed by courts that prever principal preservations over investment potential.  UGMA/UTMA accounts are more flexible, but the minors get control of the assets at 21.  Assigning a guardian as a beneficiary can be probelmatic since they are not required to use the assets for the benefit of the minor.

If a married client dies without a will, the surviving spouse will inherit the estate.  The surviving spouse may choose to not include the children, especially in cases of a second marriage.  A **SLAT** (spousal lifetime access trust) addresses these issues.

A **supplimental needs trust** is a trust that is used to provide for the needs of a beneficiary who is disabled to avoid them being disqualified for public assistance.

Trusts can protect beneficiaries that have creditor issues to avoid creditors from seizing the assets.  A **spendthrift trust** protects the beneficiary by only providing funds for discretionary benefits (i.e. no mandatory distributions).

**Testamentary trusts** are created in a will and are not revocable.  They are used to transfer assets to beneficiaries after the client's death.  They are not subject to the same restrictions as revocable trusts.  Children don't have to receive the assets at a certain age, so the terms of the trust are more flexible than UTMA/UGMA accounts.

Strategies for reducing wealth transfer taxes:
* Lifetime transfers:  Transfers to a trust or beneficiary during the client's lifetime are not subject to wealth transfer taxes.  Family Limited Partnerships (FLPs), Intentionally Defective Grantor Trusts (IDGTs), and Grantor Retained Annuity Trusts (GRATs) are common strategies for discounting valuations and especially good for family businesses.
* Irrevocable life insurance trusts (ILITs):  Life insurance proceeds are not subject to estate tax, so an ILIT can be used, but is irrevocable.
* Efficient estate tax deductions: Estate tax charitable deductions and marital deductions can be used to reduce the estate tax.  The estate tax charitable deduction is limited to 30% of the estate tax base.  The marital deduction allows the surviving spouse to inherit the estate tax free.

**Inter Vivo Gifting** is the process of transferring assets to a beneficiary during the client's lifetime.  Factors to cconsider:
* Giving away appreciated assets is not tax-efficient since the capital gains tax is deferred until the asset is sold.  These appreciated assets get a step up in basis upon death.  Gifting assets that have low or no growth potential is more tax-efficient.
* Gifting cash has no tax implications.
* The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 creates excemptions that are best taken advantage of while they are still available.
* Allocating gifting to a single parent is more tax-efficient than splitting the gifting between multiple parents.

**Secure Act** (2019) changes to gifting:
* Stretch IRA:  The stretch IRA was eliminated for non-spouse beneficiaries.  The beneficiaries must take distributions within 10 years of the IRA owner's death.  Naming spouse as the beneficiary of an IRA is still the best way to stretch the IRA.
* A surviving spouse can disclaim their spouse's IRA, which will be passed to the surviving spouse's estate.  This can be used to avoid the stretch IRA.
* Naming minor children as beneficiaries of an IRA extends the stretch IRA 10 year window.
* A Charitable Remainder Trust can be use to emulate a stretch IRA, and can sometimes be more tax-efficient.
  * Downfalls of a CRT:  not flexible, if heir dies the assets go to charity

### Trusts

A trust is a legal entity that holds, invests, and distributes assets for the benefit of others.  

The Trust Chasis: The **grantor** gives assets (the **Trust Corpus**) to the **trustee** to hold **for the benefit Of (FBO)** the **beneficiaries**.

Managing wealth is the main purpose of trusts.  Grantors have influence and can favor specific beneficiaries. Trusts are governed by state law and can last any amount of time.  Grantors can sometimes act against default state law.  The grantor names a trustee to manage the trust. For low net worth clients, the trustee is an **individual** (spouse, friend, relative).  For high net worth clients, the trustee is a **professional trustee**, who is more skilled.  A professional trustee could also act as a co-trustee to assist an individual trustee.

Situations that merit the use of a trust:
* $500,000 or more in assets
* Desire to avoid probate
* Desire for a flexible and secure distribution plan
* Anticipated problems with creditors
* Beneficiaries that are minors
* Expected wealth beyond the federal estate tax exemption
* Enough wealth to use a multi-generation vehicle to save federal estate taxesand generation-skipping transfer taxes

In a revocable trust, the grantor can change the terms of the trust or reclaim the assets at any time.  In an irrevocable trust, the grantor cannot change the terms of the trust or reclaim the assets.  A **living trust** (aka inter vivos trust) is a trust created during the grantor's lifetime.  A **testamentary trust** is a trust created in a will.  After the grantor's death, the trust becomes irrevocable.

The trustee holds legal title to the assets of the trust, or named beneficiary of assets intended to be paid by the trust.  The trustee is a fiduciary to the beneficiaries.  The feduciary standard can create legal risks for the trustee.

Income and remainder beneficiaries are the beneficiaries of the trust.  The **income beneficiary** receives income from the trust, and the **remainder beneficiary** (aka principal beneficiary) receives the remaining assets of the trust after the income beneficiary's death.  The **principal** is the remaining funds of the trust after accounging for accumulated and distributed income.

#### Irrevocable Life Insurance Trust (ILIT)

An irrevocable life insurance trust (ILIT) is an irrevocable trust that is used to purchase life insurance on the grantor's life.  The ILIT avoids estate taxes.  The 2 components of the ILIT are the trust and the life insurance policy.   The owner is the ILIT, who decided the beneficiary and is responsible for paying premiums.  The client is both the insured and the grantor.  The beneficiary is also the ILIT. 

The trustee of an ILIT can be a spouse, child, friend,or professional trustee.  The beneficiary of an ILIT are typically the heirs of the grantor.  The trustee applies for the life insurance policy of the grantor.  The trustee also opens a checking account to collect transfers and pay premiums.  

A separate life insurance policy can be gifted to the into the trust, making the ILIT the owner.  The grantor must live 3 years after gifting a separate insurane policy, or the proceeds will go into the estate.

An ILIT is typically funded by premiums paid by the grantor or by transfers which may be subject to gift tax exclusion if a **present interest gift** (the recipient must be able to access the gift now via withdrawals from the checking account).  This withdrawal power is called **Crummy power**.  The trustee notifies beneficiars of their Crummy power by letter that specifies a withdraw window. 

An ILIT can provide liquidity for the estate by buying assets from the estate, which provide liquid funds for the estate.  The trust must be structured properly to allow for these types of transactions.

The death benefits will be included in the grantor's gross estate if they retain or give away policy funds, or change policy terms/beneficiaries within 3 years of the grantor's death.

ILIT assets avoid probate and are not subject to public record.  Federal estate taxes are avoided and the assets are protected from grantors and beneficiaries' creditors.

An ILIT creates an **irrocability dilemma**.  The grantor can become divorced with the spouse as the beneficiary, which cannot be changed.  The grantor can provide rules in the trust that the marriage must be in effect at the time of the grantor's death.  While other beneficiaries can be changed, a new ILIT can be purchased to change the beneficiary, and proceeds from the old ILIT can be used to the new one.

ILITs are best when the grantor is:
* Willing to make the premium payments
* Certain about the terms of the trust
* Insurable
* Has estate planning goals that outweight the costs of the ILIT
* Faces significant state inheritance estate taxes
* Has an heir with special needs

#### Income Tax Defective Trusts

Many high net worth people use trusts to shift liabilities to beneficiaries at lower tax brackets.  The **grantor trust rules** by congress make some trusts ineffective at shifting the tax burden.  **Defective trusts** are trusts that are not properly structured, shifting the tax burden to beneficiaries.  A trust is considered "defective" when the grantor retains too much control over the trust assets (i.e. they still own the assets for income tax purposes, even though they have transferred ownership for estate tax purposes).

The **Income Tax Defective Trust** is a defective trust that is treated as the grantor's for income tax purposes, but is treated separately for estate and gift tax purposes.  

**Revokable Living Trusts** are a type of income tax defective trust.  They are best whent the grantor has modest (little) assets but wants to reduce professional fees related to probate.

**Intentionally Defective Grantor Trusts (IDGTs)** are a type of income tax defective trust.  They are best for high net worth clients that want to reduce estate taxes.

One or more of the following grantor rights must be present in an Income Tax Defective Trust:
* The right to revoke the trust
* The right to have income distributed to the grantor or grantor's spouse
* The right to have income of the trust be used to pay premiums on life insurance for the grantor or grantor's spouse
* The right to borrow money from the trust without interest or security
* The right to control the distributions to trust beneficiaries
* The right to borrow money from the trust without repayment in the current year
* The right to remove property from the trust and replace it with other property of equal value

The creator of the defective trust is treated as the grantor for income tax purposes if they give some of the rights of the trust to their spouse or children.  This can be avoided by requiring consent of an adverse party (one who has opposing interests) for distributions.

Example of an Intentionally Defective Trust:
1. The client removes assets from their estate and places them in the trust.  This is considered a gift for income tax purposes.  The trust issues a note to the grantor for the value of the assets.
2. The sale of assets in the trust does not generate capital gains tax for the grantor.  The grantor only pays taxes on interest and earnings from the note.
3. The grantor removes the appreciation of the assets from the trust and places them in their estate, which avoids estate and wealth transfer taxes.
4. Grantor paid income tax deducts the gross estate and allows the trust assets to grow faster.

Intentionally Defective Trusts are complex and are best for high net worth clients ($10 million+ or business owners).  Benefits include:
* Removes property from the client's estate for gift and estate tax purposes
* The grantor only pays income tax on the trust's income, not the appreciation of the assets.  This further reduces the grantor's estate.
* Sale of the grantor's appreciated assets that go into the trust are not subject to capital gains tax.

#### Revocable Living Trust Planning

Revocable Living Trusts aid in estate planning.  There are not immediate tax benefits, but they can be used to avoid probate fees.  If the grantor becomes impaired, the successor trustee (a fiduciary) can manage the trust assets.  At the grantor's death, the trust becomes irrevocable and the assets in the trust are treated as non-probate transfers.

#### Types of Trusts

* **Asset Protection Trusts** are used to protect assets from the beneficiaries creditors and lawsuits.  Also known as a **spendthrift trust**.  Distributions are discretionary.  The trustee can be an individual or a corporate trustee.  The trust can be revocable or irrevocable.
  * Tax benefits: Protects property from creditors
  * Tax consequences: Trust assets are excluded from grantor's estate.
  * Useful for: Protect homes and other property in Medicaid payback states (and from other creditors). Must plan in accordance with applicable lookback periods.
* **Exemption Planning Trusts** are used to pass assets to beneficiaries and are sheltered from estate taxes. Spousal access is limited to income with limited invasion powers. The trustee can be an individual or a corporate trustee.  These trusts can have a long duration.
* **Dynasty Trusts** are used to hold wealth for the grantor's beneficiarias across multiple generations.  They are formed in states that don't have limits on trust duration.  The trustee is corporate.  They are funded by the exemption amounts.  Beneficiaries don't receive large distributions in order to shelter wealth transfer taxes.
* **Grantor-Retained Annuity Trusts** (GRATs) are wealth transfer trusts funded during the grantor's lifetime to avoid the gift tax. The grantor has **retained interest** in the assets in the trust in the form of a fixed annuity.  When the GRAT terminates, the assets are distributed to the beneficiaries or retained in the trust until the grantor's death.  The taxable gift is the present value of the assets remaining after the annuity payments are made.  If the grantor dies before the GRAT terminates, the assets are distributed to the beneficiaries and may be subject to estate tax. The trustee can be an individual or a corporate trustee.
  * Tax benefits: Allows grantor to receive an income stream from trust assets. Remainder of the trust is a gift to remainder beneficiaries.
  * Tax consequences: Remainder is subject to gift tax. Income stream is taxable income to beneficiary (usually the grantor).
  * Useful for: High net worth estates
* **Intentionally Defective Grantor Trusts** (IDGTs) are used to reduce estate taxes.  The trustee can be an individual or a corporate trustee.  The grantor pays all of the income tax, allowing the trust to grow withoug a tax drag.
  * Tax benefits: Allows grantor to transfer wealth via gift or asset sale to the trust
  * Tax consequences: Trust assets are excluded from grantor's estate. Income earned by the trust is taxable to the grantor.
  * Useful for: Protecting assets from creditors, allows assets to be swapped in and out of trust, no capital gain recognized on sale of assets to trust by grantor
* **Irrevocable Life Insurance Trusts** (ILITs) are used to purchase life insurance on the grantor's life.  This trust avoids estate taxes.  The grantor's spouse may receive income from the trust and have limited access rights. The trustee can be an individual or a corporate trustee.
  * Tax benefits: Protect death benefits from estate creditors, reduce taxable estate
  * Tax consequences: Reduces taxable estate by the amount of the death benefit
  * Useful for: States with estate or inheritance tax applied on life insurance benefits
* **Qualified Domestic Trusts** (QDTs) hold assets for a surviving spouse that is not a citizen of the United States. This trust preserves the marital deduction.  The trust can be created by the surviving spouse or the grantor.  A corporate trustee is required if the fund is greater that $2 million.  Estate taxes are levied on the surviving spouse's distributions.  It's beneficial for the surviving spouse to become a U.S. citizen.
* **Qualified Personal Residence Trusts** (QPRTs) are irrevocable trusts that hold a client's primary residence.  The grantor can live in the residence for a term of years, and then the residence is transferred to the beneficiaries.  The transfer of the residence is considered a gift and is sheltered by the grantor's lifetime gift tax exemption.  If the grantor dies before the term of the trust expires, the residence is included in the grantor's gross estate.  The trustee can be an individual or a corporate trustee.  If the grantor wants to live in the residence after the term, a rental agreement can be used.
  * Tax benefits: Excludes appreciation on real estate from taxable estate, allows transfer of residence to beneficiaries while maintaining grantor's ability to live in the home for a certain period of time
  * Tax consequences: Often written so that assets are included in grantor's estate, in order to achieve basis step up. Income earned by the trust assets is taxable to the grantor.
  * Useful for: High net worth estates; estates with significant expected appreciation on residences
* **Qualified Terminable Interest Property Trusts** (QTIPs) are marital deduction trusts created by the IRS.  The surviving spouse does not have unlimited access to the trust's assets.  This is used to protect the trust's assets from the surviving spouse's children from another marriage.  The trustee can be an individual or a corporate trustee.
  * Tax benefits: Allows grantor to make marital gifts to spouse during life or at death. Trust makes income distributions to spouse while alive, and remainder is transferred to beneficiaries of grantor's choosing.
  * Tax consequences: Assets are not included in grantor's estate, but remainder assets are included in spouse's taxable estate. Passed tax-free to spouse via spousal deduction.
  * Useful for: Provides income to spouse and also ensures assets are transferred to grantor's beneficiaries. Very useful in blended families.
* **Spousal Limited Access Trusts** (SLATs) have the surviving spouse as the income beneficiary, but with limited access rights.  When the surviving spouse dies, the trust assets are distributed to the beneficiaries.  The trustee can be an individual or a corporate trustee.  Other types of trusts can also be SLATs.
  * Tax benefits: Allows grantor to make marital gifts to spouse during life or at death. Income beneficiary can be spouse and other family members.
  * Tax consequences: Trust assets are not included in grantor's estate. Passed tax-free to beneficiaries via lifetime exemption (not spousal deduction)
  * Useful for: Provides income to spouse and other beneficiaries.
* **Revokable Living Trusts** are a type of income tax defective trust.  They are best whent the grantor has modest (little) assets but wants to reduce professional fees related to probate.
  * Tax benefits: flexible, easily changed, removes assets from probate, grantor can participate while alive, can be used to plan the grantor's disability or incapacity
  * Tax consequences: does not reduce estate, gift, or inheritance taxes
  * Useful for: streamlines management, distribution, and transfer of assets, can be easily changed
* **Irrevocable Trusts** are trusts that cannot be changed once created.  They are irrevocable for estate tax purposes.  They are irrevocable for gift tax purposes if the grantor retains a present interest.  They are irrevocable for income tax purposes if the grantor retains a present interest.
  * Tax benefits: Estate tax and probate avoidance/reduction, protects assets from estate creditors
  * Tax consequences: Removes assets from probate and removes appreciation of trust assets from grantor's taxable estate
  * Useful for: Streamlines management, distribution, and transfer of assets while alive and at death. Cannot be changed easily.
* **Testamentary trusts** are created in a will and are not revocable.  They are used to transfer assets to beneficiaries after the client's death.  They are not subject to the same restrictions as revocable trusts.  Children don't have to receive the assets at a certain age, so the terms of the trust are more flexible than UTMA/UGMA accounts.
  * Tax benefits: Trust is created after grantor's death
  * Tax consequences: Does not remove assets from probate or reduce any estate, gift, or inheritance tax.
  * Useful for: Streamlines management, distribution, and transfer of probate assets at death. Useful in states with low probate costs.
* **Charitable Remainder Trusts** (CRATs/CRUTs) are irrevocable trusts that provide income to the beneficiaries for a term of years, and then the assets are distributed to charity.  The trustee can be an individual or a corporate trustee.
  * Tax benefits: Allows grantor to receive an income stream from trust assets. Remainder of the trust is a charitable gift to charitable beneficiary.
  * Tax consequences: Remainder is not subject to gift tax because the recipient is a charity; grantor takes an income tax deduction as well as gift tax deduction when assets are transferred into the trust. Income stream is taxable income to beneficiary (usually the grantor).
  * Useful for: High net worth estates
* **Charitable Lead Trusts** (CLTs) are irrevocable trusts that provide income to the charity for a term of years, and then the assets are distributed to the beneficiaries.  The trustee can be an individual or a corporate trustee.
  * Tax benefits: Allows grantor to ensure trust assets stay within the family. Remainder of the trust is gift to grantor's beneficiaries. Charity receives an income stream from trust assets.
  * Tax consequences:Grantor takes income tax deduction for annuity stream to charity. Remainder is a taxable gift because recipients are individual beneficiaries.
  * Useful for: High net worth estates
* **Special Needs Trusts** are irrevocable trusts that provide for the needs of a beneficiary who is disabled or otherwise unable to manage their own affairs.  The trustee can be an individual or a corporate trustee.
  * Tax benefits: Allows disabled beneficiaries to have assets available for quality of life needs while remaining eligible for government programs
  * Tax consequences: First party SNTs are included in the beneficiary/grantor's estate. Third party SNTs are excluded from the beneficiary's estate.
  * Useful for: Providing assets to beneficiaries with special needs
* **Power of Appointment Trusts** are irrevocable trusts that allow the grantor to appoint assets to beneficiaries.  The trustee can be an individual or a corporate trustee.
  * Tax benefits: Allows grantor to make marital gifts to spouse during life or at death. Spouse has power of appointment over trust assets.
  * Tax consequences: Trust assets are included in spouse's estate if the trust is a general power of appointment trust. Assets are not included in the spouse's estate if the trust is a limited power of appointment or HEMS trust.
  * Useful for: Provides flexible and unrestricted income to spouse while ensuring remainder goes to named beneficiaries

### Life Insurance Strategies

#### Tax Issues for Life Insurance

Life insurance death benefits are not treated as taxable income in most cases.  The **transfer-for-value trap** happens when the owner of the policy assigns the policy to another person.  The basis is the amount paid for the policy plus and premiums. 5 exemptions to the transfer-for-value trap are if the policy is assigned to:
* The insured
* A partnership where the insured is a partner
* A partner of the insured
* A corporation where the insured is a shareholder, officer, or employee
* A transferee who takes the income tax basis of the transferor in the policy (gifted policy, transfer to ILIT)

Situtions where life insurance death benefits qualify for the estate tax:
* The estate is the beneficiary
* The beneficiary is directed to pay the expenses of the estate
* Has **incidence of ownership** within 3 years prior to the insured's death
  * Incidence of ownership any legal or economic value that the insured has in the policy
    * Right to name or change the beneficiary
    * Access the policy's cash surrender value
    * Using the policy to secure a loan
    * Business owned life insurance if the insured is a controlling shareholder or general partner unless the proceeds benefit the business or the business's creditors.

Employer-owned life insurance is not subject to income tax if:
* The employee was given notice of the application and the employee provided consent
* The proceeds go to a family member or are used to purchase equity in the business

Gift taxes occur if a life insurance policy is transferred at a cost below full and adequate consideration (fair market value).  An inadvertent gift happens when the insured is not the policy owner (the transferor is responsible for the gift tax).

The wealth manager should reevaluate implications when the policy changes assignment or changes beneficiary.

## Charitable Planning Goals

### Donor Advised Funds (DAFs)

A donor advised fund has most of the benefits of a private foundation (requires annual payout), but is easier to set up and manage.  A DAF is a wrapper around a mutual fund (aka Charatible Bucket) that makes payments to 501(c)(3) charities.  There is no required annual payout. The minimum amount to start a DAF is $5k - $10k.  While private foundataions require a 990-T filing that includes a detailed accounting of the foundation's structure and investments, DAFs are anonymous.  A DAF can use cash, publicly traded stock, bonds, business interests, and real estate as the funding source and are deducted at fair market value (FMV).

The only advantage of a private foundation are prestige and have a perpetual life.

Main uses of a DAF:
* Philanthropic Training Wheel: a good start to charitable giving which can lead to creating a private foundation
* Stockpile Giving Dollars: contributing while income is high and then making distributions when in retirement
* Business Transition Planning: placing part or all of the business in a DAF to avoid capital gains tax and to lessen part of the business sold outside of the DAF

Questions to consider when recommending a DAF:
* How long will money be in the DAF?
* How much to they want to give each year?
* Will more money be added in the future?
* Do they want the DAF to grow for generations?

An Investment Policy Statement (IPS) should be created for large DAFs, though a balanced mutual fund is usually sufficient for smaller DAFs.

Total Philanthropic Portfolio Activation: investing in socially responsible funds in the DAF.

### Tax-Efficient Charitable Planning

The full income tax deduction for a charitable donation is limited each tax year. Any amount left over can be carried forward for the next 5 taxable years.  The **contribution base** is the donor’s AGI, ignoring net operating loss carrybacks. Hence, for most taxpayers it will be their adjusted gross income, or AGI.  The yearly limit is based on a percentage of the donor’s contribution base and the type of charity. The tax deduction for gift and estate tax purposes is unlimited.

**Charitable Contribution Deductions**

| Type of Property Donated                                      | Valuation for Purposes of Charitable Deduction    | Contributions Made to Public Charities and Operating Foundations | Ceiling for Other Entities                                  |
| ------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Cash                                                          | Fair market value                                 | 60%                                                              | 30%                                                         |
| Ordinary Income Property and Short-Term Capital Gain Property | Lesser of adjusted basis or the fair market value | 50%                                                              | 30%                                                         |
| Long-Term Capital Gain Tangible Property                      | Fair market value or basis                        | 30% if FMV or 50% if basis (taxpayer choice)                     | 20% (must use basis unless publicly traded stock, then FMV) |
| Long-Term Capital Gain Intangible Property                    | Fair market value or basis                        | 30% if FMV or 50% if basis (taxpayer choice)                     | 20% (must use basis)                                        |
| Long-Term Capital Gain Real Property                          | Fair market value or basis                        | 30% if FMV or 50% if basis (taxpayer choice)                     | 20% (must use basis)                                        |

The total deduction cannot exceed 50% of their contribution base in the current tax year.

Charitable donation structures:
* **Outright Gifts**:  
  * Cash: max possible income tax deduction
  * Property: limited based on type of property
* **Influence**: 
  * DAF: the donor can give guidance and recommendations, but not direction.  
  * Private Foundation: the donor can give direction, but has limits/restrictions on the income tax deduction.  Property contributed is removed from the donor's estate.  At least 5% of the private foundation's assets must be distributed to charity each year.
* **Retaining Income**:  
  * Pooled-Income Fund: Donor retains income rights based off of the amount of the gift.  Income tax deduction is taken immediately. The charity receives the principal amount when the donor dies.
  * Charitable Gift Annuity: Donor receives a fixed income stream for a term of years, and then the charity receives the principal amount when the donor dies.  Cheaper and less complex than a Charitable Remainder Trust Annuity.
  * Charitable Remainder Trust Annuity: the donor retains income for the trust term and the charity receives the remainder.
  * Charitable Lead Trust: The charity receives income for a term of years, and then the remainder is distributed to the donor's estate.
* **Gifts at Death**: Charity bequest in a will or the charity is the designated beneficiary of an asset or insurance policy.  A federal estate tax charitable deduction is available.  Donor's can change their mind before they die.

Attorneys are needed to draft charitable planning documents.  A CPA will need to assist in qualifying for deductions and satisfying compliance requirements.  Trustees will need advisors to administer the trust.  Wealth managers assist in identifying the appropriate investment vehicle.

Cash is the least tax-efficient way to make charitable donations. Income tax benefits only apply if they're above the standard deduction.  Grouping/bunching tax deductions into a single year can help exceed the standard deduction.  The DAF is the best of both worlds.

The TCJA (Tax Cuts and Jobs Act) doubled the standard deduction, making cash gifts less attractive.  It also limited the types of deductions.

Qualified Charitable Distributions (QCDs) come from an IRA (not a 401k) to a charity and apply to donors 70.5 years old and older.

### Charitable Trusts

Questions to ask when recommending a charitable trust:
* Are you interested in donating to a charity?
* Does the client have $2 million or more to donate?
* Does the client have appreciated assets that you want to donate?
* Does the client want to spread donations over multiple years?
* Does the client want to receive income/benefits from the trust property?
* Does the client want to be able to change your mind before you die?
* Will dedeuctions benefit the client?

Answering YES to 2 or more makes a charitable trust a good option. Othewise, less complex strategies like DAFs are better.

The grantor of a charitable trust can be the trustee and/or the beneficiary.  The grantor creates the trust documents. Charitable trusts are irrevocable.  Some states have specific requirements for charitable trusts.  Some charitable trusts are treated as private foundations by the IRS.

 Types of charitable trusts:
 * **Split Interest Charitable Trusts** (SICs) the beneficiary is both a charity and private individuals.  They are expesive and complex and are approproate for clients who wish to make large gifts.  They provide an immediate income tax deduction and ongoing income generation.
 * **Charitable Remainder Trusts** (CRTs) the grantors heirs are income beneficiaries within the trust term, the charity receives the remainder. They are good for clients who want some income from the trust but don't care about generational wealth.  The term cannot exceed 20 years and there are specific IRS rules regarding distributions.  The grantor of a CRT gets an income tax deduction when the property is transferred to the trust, subject to AGI limitations based on the type of property and the type of charity.  The grantor also gets a gift tax deduction for the remainder value.
   * **Charitable Remainder Annuity Trusts** (CRATs) a CRT where the income payments are a percentage of the trust's value.  Additional contributions **cannot** be made to the trust.
   * **Charitable Remainder Unitrusts** (CRUTs) a CRT where income payments are a percentage of the **annual** trust's value.  Additional contributions **can** be made to the trust.  They are most appropriate for clients who want flixibility in contributions and don't care about variable income. 
 * **Charitable Lead Trusts** (CLTs) the opposite of a CRT.  The charity is the income beneficiary, and the grantors heirs receive the remainder.  Approriate for clients who want to keep property in the family.  Income can be an annuity or a unitrust and has less limitations than a CRT.
 
### Philanthropic Goals

Clients feel underserved by advisors when it comes to philanthropic goals.  Advisors focus on taxes and finances, but the clients care about values, visions, dreams, family, and social impact. 

Philanthropic conversations to have with clients:
* Overall personal goals
* Goals for their heirs
* Areas they want to have an impact in
* Family's greatest asset
* Types of assets they want to donate
* What do they value most
* Who is their community
* Do they want their children involved
* Are heirs prepared for the wealth
* Current philanthropic activities
* Reasons for giving
* Specific charities they want to support
* Ultimate results desired
* Lifetime or testamentary gift decision
  
The philantropic learning curve was developed by H. Peter Karoff, founder of the Philanthropic Initiative.  It is a 6-step process:
1. You become a donor
2. You decide to get organized
3. You become a learner
4. You become issue and results oriented
5. Your philanthropy is leveraged
6. You values, passions and interests are aligned

Engaging spouses and children is important to fulfilling philanthropic goals. Wealth managers become trusted advisors when they can help clients with the philanthropic goals.  Managers should coordinate with accountants and attorneys for their clients.  They can also assist in converting illiquid assets into lifetime and legacy goals.

### Private Foundations

A private foundation is trust or corporation created to supoort charitable giving.  They are similar to DAFs, but private foundations give the donor more control, have more regulations, and typically involve larger sums of money. The minimum initial funding is about $1 - $3 million.  Corporations provide more control than trusts. They incorporate the donor's charitable intent, and instills the donor's charitable philosophy in their children.  Often, children can select the charities they want to support.

The maximum income tax deduction for a private foundation is 30% cash and 20% stock of the donor's contribution base.  The donor can carry forward the excess deduction for up to 5 years.  Gifting highly appreciated (publicly traded) stocks held for more than 1 year do not incur capital gains tax, and the donor can deduct the full FMV of the stock.  Private stocks are deducted at the property's cost basis.  Donations can also come from the donor's Charitable Remainder Trusts.  Contributions coming from a will or as a life insurance beneficiary get an estate tax deduction.  Lifetime gifts to private foundations receive a gift tax deduction.

To create a private foundation, the donor needs to create a corporation and file IRS form 1023 (Application for Except Determination Letter). They have a board of trustees/advisors who make the contributions (typically the donor's family). Form 990-PF is used to **publicly** report the foundation's activities. There are IRS penalties for violating the requirements.

Private foundations require several annual activities:
* File a tax return, payin 1% - 2% of it's net income
* Make qualified distributions to charity of at least 5% of the foundation's net assets

Types of Family Foundations:
* **Normal Foundation**: the most common type, it receives donations and distributes them to charity every year.  Family members (or groups of people) have complete control over the foundation.
* **Operating Foundation**: setup exclusively for a specific charitable activity.
 
Creating and managing private foundations involves attorneys, accountants, and advisors.  The wealth manager helps the clients determine whether a private foundation is appropriate for their philanthropic goals and within their financial means. They can also help create a strategy and help manage the assets of the foundation.  The strategy should be consistent with trust rules and have a return goal.  They can also help coordinate the legacy plan.

## Business Owners and Executives

### Small Business Ownership

A wealth manager can help business owners with:
* The risk characteristics of the business assets
* How assets impact the client's overall portfolio
* How to withdraw from the business while minimize taxes

Over 1/3 of all small businesses fail within the first 2 years. Professional private equity investors averaged 13% returns from 1986 - 2015. 

Returns on personal business assets are typically not greater than market returns, and are below that of market returns when adjusted for risk.  It may make sense to invest in the market instead of the business in some cases.

Owners underestimate the riskiness of investing in their own business.  They overestimate their ability to manage private equity.

Personal business assets are considered illiquid since there's no market for them. The **liquidity risk** for a business is related to the ability to sell the business at fair market value in a relatively short period of time.  High liquidity risk discounts the business valuation.

There is also a **concentration risk** associated with owning a business.  The business is likely the client's largest asset, so there's an outsized impace of the business on the overall portfolio.  Investing in non-small-cap funds outside of the business can help diversify the portfolio.

A valuation risk is that the business valuation can be subjective.  Valuations can be regularly obtained to lessen this risk.

A business owner receives financial rewards as both an investor and an employee.  

For pass-through entities, all business income is taxed at the owner's personal income tax rate.  These owners can take up to a 20% QBI deduction.  Selling a pass-through entity is subject to capital gains tax.

For corporations, the business income is taxed at the corporate flate rate of 21%, and then the owner is taxed at their personal income tax rate on the dividends.  Selling a corporation is subject to capital gains tax, ordinary inccome tax, or both.

Business owners can also indirectly benefit from things like deferred compensation plans, health insurance and retirement plans.

Business valuations should be obtained from a credible independent appraisers (Certified Business Appraisers, or CBAs, and Certified Valuation Analysts, or CVAs) so that the IRS cannot contest the value.  These valuations can be expensive and take several months to complete.  In some cases, valuations can be estimated using a multiple of the business's earnings.  For asset-intensive businesses, the value is based on the fair market value of the assets.  Comparable sales are also used to value the business.

If owners materially participate in the business, money received from the business is considered **active business income** and is taxed at the owner's personal income tax rate.  Likewise, business losses can be deducte from the owner's income.  For owners who don't materially participate in the business, the income is considered **passive business income**.

Small Business Loans:
* First create a relationship with the bank before applying for a loan
* Small business owners typically have to secure the loan with personal assets (called a **Recourse Loan**)
* 3 years of personal and business tax returns are required
* Liquid business assets and spousal income can reduce the interest rate

### Small Business Transfer Methods

**Disposition** is the process of selling a business.  The disposition team consists of a wealth manager, an attorney that specializes in business transfers, valuation experts, and more.  The wealth manager should be involved in the process to ensure the client's goals are met.  Disposition teams are needed when:
* The client wants the business to make payments to family members
* The client is facing a divorce or has creditor issues
* The client's health is impaired, making them unable to manage the business
* The client wants to retire in the near future

The time horizon of the sale can determine the disposition strategy. Immediate sales require business liquidation since buyers are difficult to find on short notice. Liquidations are typically a last resort since business assets are typically sold below fair market value.  Business obligations also need to be satisfied.  Funds are distrubuted to owners and taxed as capital gains or ordinary income for pass-through entities and double taxed for corporations.

Taxable sales are usually preferred over liquidation.  For quick taxable sales, key employees or family members are often the buyers. Business owners might need to receive payments in installments to lower the barrier to entry for buyers.

Buy-sell agreements are used to sell the business in the long-term.  A deathtime buy-sell can be funded by life insurance.  Disability buy-sell agreements can be funded by disability insurance. 

Funding methods:
* **Lump Sum**: desirable when funds are needed in the short-term, taxes are due immediately after the sale.
* **Installment Notes**: appropriate when installments match the seller's spending goals.  They are also good for short-notice sales. Payments consist of a capital gain, and interest is taxable as ordinary income, and are taxed upon receipt, which spreads the tax burden over time.  One payment must be made in the taxable year after the year of the sale.  The default risk can be mitigated by securing the notes with the business.  Reclaiming the business triggers immediate taxable gains.  The IRS requires a minimum interest rate to be used per the imputed interest and original discount rules, though the rate can be negotiated.  If the seller dies before the sale, the remainning installments are included in the seller's estate.  Because of this, shorter installments are better to avoid the estate tax.
* **Self Cancelling Installment Notes (SCINs)**: if the owner dies before the sale, the remaining payments are forgiven. Typically done between family members to provide income during the seller's remaining lifetime. This avoids the estate tax.  If a will is used instead of a SCIN, the forgiveness is treated as a taxable asset.
* **Private Annuity**: the buyer agrees to make payments to the sell for the rest of the seller's lifetime. Ideal for selles that want income for the rest of their life.  IRS tables dicatate payment amounts.  This avoids the estate tax.  The seller must pay all tax immediately and they cannot secure the annuity.  Typically done between family members.

Capital Gains on Unincorporated Businesses: sale price - owners' basis.  Hot assets are assets that have appreciated in value or are uncollected receivables, and can trigger ordinary income tax. 

**Corporate Redemption**: the corporation purchases back shares from shareholders. Redemptions are complex and heavily regulated.  All or part of the proceeds are treated as dividends.  Specialized attorneys are needed to handle the redemption. 

Corporations can purchase corporations in a **tax-free exchange**, where the owner exchanges all corporate stock or assets for stock in the acquiring corporation. The purchasing company is typically a public company so that the owner can sell stock for money.

Businesses can transfer some of the business assets to the owner.  Pass-through entites are typically taxed at capital gains rates.  Corporations are taxed at ordinary income.

When a business owner dies, the basis of their business receives a step-up in value. This makes not selling the business until death a good strategy.  A deathtime buy-sell, the estate sells the business to the purchaser after the death of the owner and pays little to no capital gains tax. 

### Retirement and Succession Planning

With proper planning, unnessary taxes can be avoided. The IRS strictly regulates business transfers between family members. Attorneys, CPAs, and valuation experts are needed to handle the process. 

Questions to ask:
* Do they want to slowly sell the business over time, or sell it all at once?
* Do they want to retain control or some decision making power?
* Is there a plan to prepare the heirs for ownership and management?
* Is the business needed to fund retirement?  If so, lump sum or installments?
* Has the business significantly appreciated in value?
* Are they facing large estate tax liabilities?

The owner must create enough liquidity in the estate to provide for their heirs and pay estate taxes. 

Transitioning Control:
* Fully or partially transition control to heirs prior to retirement
* Income needed from the transition can affect the timing and terms of the sale.  
* A **buy-sell agreement** can be used to sell the business.  
* Alternatively, the business can be gifted to the heirs, which lifetime exemption could shield from federal gift and estate taxes.  
* Another option is to gift the business to heirs but retain income rights from the business through a trust.
* The IRS ensures that the sale of the business is set at fair market value.  Valuations are included in the buy-sell agreement.  **Pegging** is the process of setting the price of the business, which dictates the estate tax liability.
* Under the **anti-estate freezing rule**, a gifted business interest will be fully taxable to the grantor if in excess of the annual gift tax exclusion.  The business interest can be gifted to a GRAT/GRUT to avoid this.  This can also be avoid by **stock recapitalization** where the owner converts some common stock to preferred or non-voting stock.  The remaining common stock is then gifted to the heirs. The IRS heavily regulates stock recapitalizations.
* **Family Limited Partnerships** (FLPs) can be created, and interests in the partnership are gifted to the heirs. The IRS heavily regulates FLPs.

Bequeathing business interests benefits taxes by creating a step-up in basis. Since estate taxes are incurred at death, there needs to be sufficient liquidity to pay for it.

**Special valuation rules** allow business (and farm real estate) to be valued at it's current use instead of fair market value when calcuating estate tax, which is good for businesses that can be converted into higher value.

The **Section 303 rule** allows corporations to treat redemptions as capital gains instead of dividends, which ends up being little to no capital gains tax as a result of the step-up in basis. There are limits to this rule.

For heirs not inheriting the business, a life insurance trust can be used as a bequest to them.

Steps to choosing a buseiness exit strategy:
1. Understand the business and determine the sale price
2. Determine the payment terms and preferred structure (e.g. lump sum, installment notes, SCINs, private annuity)
3. Select a buyer
   * If a family member, consider gifting vs selling
   * If an employee, consider options
   * For all other, consider a buy-sell agreement

Considerations for Selling:
* Determine capital gains
* Payment terms

Considerations for Gifting:
* Gift tax implications
* Creating equity for other heirs

### Business Entities

There are more than 30 million small businesses in the US.

4 major types of business entities:
* **Sole Proprietorship**: makes up 70% of small businesses, simplest, has 1 owner, must rely on personal assets to secure funding, has unlimited liability (business and personal assets at risk), pass-through taxation, buy sell agreements are recommended for succession planning
* **Partnership**: makes up 10% of small businesses, for general partnerships, every partner is a general partner who can make decisions on behalf of the business, has unlimited liability, limited partnerships where limited partners don't have any control of the business but also enjoy limited liability, pass-through taxation, buy sell agreements are recommended for succession planning
* **Limited Liability Company (LLC)**: makes up 10% of small businesses, has limited liability protection, control can be delegated to individual owners or non-members, pass-through taxation, buy sell agreements are recommended for succession planning
* **Corporation**: makes up 20% of small businesses, provides easy inflow of capital, has retained earnings, separate legal entity, has a perpetual life, owners have limited liability, complex and expensive to set up, double taxation of C-Corps, S-Corps have the legal status of corporations but are pass-through entities (restrictions on number and citizenship of shareholders, can avoid some FICA taxes via dividends though IRS regulates this)

Choosing an entity type:
* Consider tax implications, asset protections, level of complexity

### Deferred Compensation Plans

Funding a non-qualified plan:
* Life insurance
* Investments (mutual funds)
* Operating reventu and existing assets
* Funding as a corporate asset or in a Robbi trust

4 differeneces between qualified and unfunded non-qualified plans:
1. Timing of the employer's deduction
2. Scope of who is covered by the plan
3. The forefitable nature of the benefits
4. The tax treatment of the returns on amounts set aside for beneficiary payments

Qualified Plans
* Best for employers who prefer immediate deductions (the match)
* High cost of providing the plan since they must be offered to all employees
* Restrictions on benefits
* Most common are profit-sharing or 401(k), but also includes SEP IRAs, SIMPLE IRAs, 403(b) and 401(a)
* Annual deferral limit for a 401(k) plan is $23,000 (+$7,500 if 50+)
* The maximum includable compensation is $345,000 (benefits stop after this amount)

Non-qualified plans
* Best for employers who wants flexibility in **who** can participate (this is what makes it non-qualified)
* Owners may be included in the plan
* There is no maximum contribution limit
* Intended for highly paid and senior management
* The employer deducts contributions only when the employee receives the benefit
* **Elapsing of the time-based or performance-based risk of forfeiture** = the employer owns all contributions and earnings it has set aside for the plan until some point in time.

Funding non-qualified plans can be formal or informal
  * **Formal Funding**: not available to the employer's creditors, employee is immediately taxed on the contributions, rarely used
  * **Informal Funding**: available to the employer's creditors, employee is taxed on the contributions when received, most common

**Corporate Owned Life Insurance (COLI)**: type of informal funding, the business is both the owner and the beneficiary, the executive is the insured, heirs receive the benefit if the employee dies before receiving the benefit, very tax efficient b/c growth is not taxed

**Rabbi Trust**: type of informal funding, manages risk, the trust holds non-qualified payments, available to the employer's creditors, protects employees from the employer, not the employer's creditors

### Employer Defined Contribution Plans

Employer Defined Contribution Plans (DC) are the primary employer-sponsored retirement plans.  DC plans are offered by small and large businesses.  They are a basic benefit designed to attract and retain employees.  They are a tax-advantaged retirement savings vehicle. The 401(k) is the most common, where some employers match employee contributions.  Contributions are typically invested, with the investment risk being borne by the employee. Most DC plans are **participant directed** (they pick the amount and the investments). More uncertain that DB plans.  DC plans are voluntary.  Employers are the sponsors and act as fiduciaries.  Most plans fall under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA).

In **Defined Benefit Plans (DB)**, the employer makes all of the contributions and bears the investment risk. Employees receive a guaranteed benefit at a predetermined date.

3 steps to DC plan management:
* Follow regulatory, reporting, and administrative requirements, and monitor service providers. 
* Determine and document the plan’s design (employee eligibility and terms for contributions and withdrawals) and select service providers.
* Build an investment menu for diversification.

Plan sponsors (employers) look to advisors to help manage the plan, and may require coordination with service providers, custodians, attorneys, coordination staff, and employer committees.  The plan sponsor is ultimately responsible for the plan.  The Department of Labor (and many states) have been drafting proposed rules to update the definition of fiduciary.

We assume that employer wants everyone to save for retirement.

The 3 F's of of an advisor:
* **Funds**: select the plan's assets
* **Fees**: analyze the plan's costs
* **Fiduciaries**: ensure compliance with regulations

2 types of DC plan advisors:
* **3(21) advisor**: is a fiduciary if they exercise discretionary authority over the plan and it's assets, provide advice for a fee, or have the responsibility to administer the plan.
* **3(38) investment manager**: is a fiduciary who has power to manage, acquire, dispose of the plan's assets, they are registered investment advisors, banks or insurance companies, 

While previously there were an overwhelming number of DC fund options, the current best practice it to limit options to about 10 funds.  This is achieved by **streamlining** and **tiering** the fund options.

3 DC investment fund categories:
* **Capital Growth Funds**: equity funds and alternative investments, broad based domestic and international best for diversification, best for young and aggressive investors
* **Income Producing Funds**: buffers against market volatility, lower returns and lower volatility, fixed income consisting of **total return** or bond market portfolios, best for conservative investors
* **Capital Preservation Funds**: low volatility, low returns, money market funds and stable value funds with insurance contracts, best for investors near or at retirement

3 types of funds in a DC plan (all are QDIA plans):
* **Balanced Funds**: aka asset allocation funds, a mix of growth and income funds into a single fund, used frequently in the past before target date funds were available, labels include "conservative", "moderate", "aggressive"
* **Target Date Funds**: automatically adjusts the asset allocation based on the investor's target retirement date, the fund mix is called the "glide path", they are the qualified default investment alternative (QDIA) for 401(k) plans from the Pension Protection Act of 2006
* **Asset Allocation Services**: the investor selects the funds

The Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) requires at least 3 funds in a DC plan that are:
* Diversified
* Available to all participants
* Has marterially different risk and return characteristics
* Allows appropriate risk and return targets when aggregated
* Enable the participants to minimize risk through diversification

Due dilligence when selecting funds (below) and then ranking them:
* Investment philosophy and process
* Key personnel
* Performance history
* Operational capabilities

The Pension Protection Act of 2006 create broad availability to automatic enrollment of new and existing employees in 401(k) plans.  The SECURE Act of 2019 increased the maximum automatic enrollment rate from 10% to 15% of compensation.  SECURE Act 2.0 of 2025 increased the starting rate to 3% in and climbing up 1% per year until 10% (called **auto escalation**).  Employees can opt out of the plan.  Companies with less than 10 employees are exempt from these rules.  Auto escalation is stopped when contribution limits are reached.  Default savings rates are 3%, but plans are now implementing a default savings rate of 6%.  **Investment re-enrollment** is the process of automatically re-enrolling employees in the plan after they have opted out.

It's best for plan sponsors (employers) to outsource the administration of the plan to a third party in order to avoid the fiduciary liability.

### Executive Compensation Strategies

**Incentive Stock Option Plans (ISOs)**:
* For executives and key employees
* Company equity at a discount
* ISOs grant employees the option to purchase company stock at a set price (aka exercise or strike price)
* May require a vesting period
* Difference between the market price and the strike prices is called the **bargain element**
* Favorable tax treatment if the ISO can be exercisable within 10 years of the grant date and the most stock that can be purchased annually is $100,000
* Exercising an ISO within the appropriate timeframe is not taxable but the bargin element contributes to the alternative minimum tax (AMT)
* May create a concentrated position in the company
* Must be held at least 2 years from the grant and 12 months from the exercise date
* Sale of stock triggers capital gains tax if all requirements are met, otherwise it's treated as ordinary income

**Nonincentive Stock Option Plans (NSOs)**:
* A constatutory or nonqualified stock option plan
* No favorable tax treatment
* Subject to fewer restrictions
* Exercising triggers ordinary income tax equal to the bargain element
* May create a concentrated position in the company
* Must be held at least 12 months from the exercise date
* Sale of stock triggers capital gains tax if all requirements are met, otherwise it's treated as ordinary income

It may be best to exercise the stock options when the market price is equal to the strike price.  This minimizes capital gains, ordinary income and AMT taxes.  This also lessens the concntraton risk.  If stock prices are falling before the 12 month period and rcover isn't expected, it may still make sense to exercise the options in order to minimize the loss.  **Cashless exercise** may be an option under the plan, the option can be exercised and sold in a single transaction. 

If a client if facing an AMT where their ordinary tax is more than the AMT, then exercising the options to increase the AMT to the point that equals the ordinary income tax doesn't involve any additional taxes. In some cases, increasing AMT exposure can actually reduce the tax rate by taking them out of the AMT.

**Restricted Stock Units (RSUs)**:
* The stock is issued directly to the employee and is subject to restrictions
* Risks of forfeiture are either time-based or performance-based
  * Time-based restriction may require the employee to be employed for a certain period of time
  * Performance-based restriction may require the employee or company to meet certain performance goals
* No tax consequences until the time-base or performance-based restriction is met (vested), then it's considered ordinary income
* The employer can deduct the cost of the stock as an expense
* Making a timely 83(b) election converts the ordinary income to capital gains by accelerating the income recognition

### Small Business Financial Statements

A **ratio** is just a comparison of two numbers. Having a single positive ratio isn't a good indicator of financial health if other ratios are negative.  Ratios make it easier to compare companies.

A **profitibality ratio** provide info about the strength and effectiveness of a company's operations. A **profit margin** is the percentage of each dollar of revenue that is left over after all expenses are paid.

> Profit Margin = Net Income / Net Sales Revenue

The **gross profit margin** is the percentage of each dollar of revenue that is left over after the cost of goods sold is paid.  The gross profit margin is only useful for companies that sell products.

> Gross Profit Margin = Gross Profit / Net Sales Revenue = (Net Sales Revenue - Cost of Goods Sold) / Net Sales Revenue

One can compare the profit margin of a compnay across multiple years to see if expenses are rising faster than revenue. CPAs can perform a cost analysis to pinpoint the source (rising expenses, falling revenue, under pricing, etc.).  Rising profits can mask certin problems (lower quality products, lower quality service, etc.).  

Profit margins can also be used to compare companies within the same industry.  Rising margins may point to key strengths (key employees, etc.). Falling margins may point to key weaknesses (bad location, high vendor costs, etc.).

**Expense Ratios** are used to determine how well the company is using its resources. Expense ratios can be compared across multiple years to see if expenses are rising or falling over time.  Individual expenses can also be compared across multiple years.  Variable costs can also be compared to net sales.

> Expense Ratio = Expense / Net Sales

The **current ratio** is a liquidity ratio that shows the company's ability to pay its short-term obligations. Current assets are assets that can be converted to cash within 1 year. Current liabilities are debts that must be paid within 1 year.  Generally, a current ratio of at least 1 is considered healthy.  Less than 1 indicates a need for additional cash.  More than 2 may indicate that the company isn't using extra funds efficiently.

> Current Ratio = Current Assets / Current Liabilities

The **quick ratio** like the current ratio, but assets and liabilities are considered in a shorter term (90 days).  Some liability are more beneficial than others.

The **debt-to-equity ratio** expresses the amount of liability for each dollar of equity.

> Debt-to-Equity Ratio = Total Liabilities / Total Equity

It's helpful to compare balance sheets and income statements across several multiple years.  This can help identify trends over time.  Examples include Revenue vs Income and Expense as part of Income

**Return on Equity (ROE)** measures the average return vs the amount the owner has invested in the company.

> Return on Equity = Net Income / Average Owner' Equity

**Return on Invested Capital (ROIC)** shows the efficiency in allocating capital to provide returns to investors.

> Return on Invested Capital = (Net Income - Distibutions) / Invested Capital

## Specialized Planning

### Diverse Family Structures

The concept of a family has evolved to include unmarried parents, multi-generational family, step families and single parent househoulds.  Managers may need to talk to family members individually and encourage **financial fidelity** (honest communcation about finances).

Married couples can either file jointly or separately.  The **marriage penalty** is a bit of a misnomer and only applicable in certain cases.  In other cases, there are benefits for filing jointly.  A **dependency deduction** CANNOT be taken on a stay-at-home parent.    Married tax payers get a $500,000 exemption when selling their primary residence (as opposed to $250,000 for individuals) if they live in the property in 2 of the last 5 years. An unmarried partner can qualify for a $14,000 adoption credit on the other partner's child, but this does not apply when married.  Unmarried small business owners don't have to consider if their partner qualifies for health insurance at their employer.

Married benefits in retirement:
* A working spouse can contribute to an IRA on behalf of a non-working spouse
* After death, the surviving spouse can roll over the IRA to their own IRA
* Can claim each other's Social Security benefits after death or up to 50% of the working spouse's benefit while alive (this can be 100% if the claiming spouse is caring for a qualified child)
* **Portability** is using the below 2 rules together:
  * The **mariatal deduction** allows spouses to leave qualified property to each other free of gift or estate tax
  * The surviving spouse has access to the unused portion of the deceased spouse's federal estate tax exemption
* Avoids probate for property not in a will
* Easier to purchase life insurance on a spouse
* Has access to military and veterans benefits and COBRA
* A widowed taxpayer who cares for a dependent child may file as a married taxpayer for up to 2 years

Cons:
* Debt is considered marital debt
* Both incomes are considered for financial aid

Unmarried partner options for spousal IRAs after death:
* Transfer the funds into an inherited IRA beneficiary distribution account (aka non-spousal IRA), subject to minimum required distributions and not subject to early withdrawal penalties
* The entire IRA must be distributed within 10 years, the beneficiary is taxed on the distribution, not subject to early withdrawal penalties
* Take the funds in a lump sum distribution, has tax penalties so most attractive for a Roth IRA, subject to early withdrawal penalties

A single person has more limited earning capability and less security than a married person, so disabiity and long-term care insurance are more important. Also, single people with children need to have fully thought-out custody arrangements.  Head of household filing status is available to single parents with children, which has greater tax benefits than single filing status.

Considerations for blended families:
* Short and long-term financial plans should be created for the new family
* Children from prior marriages may need to be addressed, including child support (not tax deductible)
* Review all asset ownership documents, beneficiary designations, trusts, and retirement accounts
* Estate plans may need to be created for each spouse in order to accommodate the new and previous family

#### Divorce Planning

50% of the population will go through a divorce. Client relationhips can be strengthened during this time.  Gathering financial information can be challenging, though both parties are required to disclose information, which can take time.  States where clients work and reside will have different laws.  The most imporant issues in a divorce are money, property, children and pets.  Most divorces settle out of court. A divorce settlement is difficult to change (except in cases of fraud or mutual agreement), so it's important to get it right.

A divorce planning team consists of a divorce attorney, a CPA, a divorce coach, a mediator, and a financial professional.  Wealth managers need to understand their client's current financial situation and what they want their future situation to look like.  They also need to work with other members of the divorce team.  If the manager worked with the couple, it may be unethical to work with one of the parties.  A maritial cash flow analysis is created to ascertain the maritial financial lifestyle.  A post-divorce cash flow analysis is then created to determine the feasibility of their personal financial goals.  Goals that cannot be met should be modified in some way (either funding or spending).

Property in a divorce is either marital property, community property, or separate property.  40 states follow an equitable distribution model, where the property is divided "fairly" (but not necessarily equally) between the parties. Liabilities typically follow the asset they secure.  Community property is split 50/50 between the parties.  In a divorce, all property is considered marital property unless proven otherwise.  Separate property is property that was owned before the marriage or received as a gift, inheritance, or settlement.  Separate property is not subject to division, though proof of separate property is required.  If separate propery is **comingled** (e.g. retirement accounts, bank accounts, investement accounts) with marital property, it may be subject to division.  **Transmuted property** is property that was separate property but becomes marital property due to the actions of one of the parties (e.g. joint-titling a house after the marriage).

There is marital debt and separate debt. Debt is divided in a divorce similat to assets.  Jointly held debt can be cumbersome to divide. It's advisable to pay off joint debt at the time of the divorce. 

After a divorce, a person can file as single or head of household. The basis on transferred assets carries over to the new owner. Subsequent gains or losses are handled by the new owner. Real estate can be sold and the proceeds divided, or one party can buy out the other or the property can be rented out.  Real estate can become emotionally charged in a divorce.  For jointly titled property that is only occupoed by one part, the other party becomes an investor in the property (and still assumes part of the debt and risk).  Rental property can be sold or split.

Retirement assets can be split, retained, or offset with other assets in a settlement.  The date used to value retirement assets is called the **date of division** or **date of valuation**, which can be the date of the divorce, the date the divorce was finalized, or a date agreed upon by both parties.  The date the assets are split is called the **date of segregation**, which can happen months after the date of division. Valuation of retirement assets needs to account for taxes.

Businesses are considered income, an asset, or both.  Typically, 15% to 30% of the business is given to the non-controlling party, depending on what contributions were made to the business. Hostile spouses don't make good co-owners, so other options should be considered. Business assets can be considered for division.  Business income is considered like any other income. Businesses need to be valued by a certified professional.  Divorce valuations are different from valuations for selling a business.  It's common for a party owning a business with value to buy out the other party, which can be in the form of an offset from another marital asset, a lump sum, or a note to pay over time.  Business with multiple partners typically buy out the non-controlling party.

Term life insurance has no value in a divorce.  Term policies where the spouse is covered in a term rider, only the primary insured can retain the policy.  The cash value in a permanent life insurance policy is considered a marital asset that can be divided, though dividing the cash value may surrender the policy.  Like a term policy, the primary insured is the only person who can retain the policy.  Older couples may have survivorship or a second-to-die policy require cafeful consideration. A spouse responsible for child support will need a life insurance policy to cover the child support payments. Transferring the ownership of a policy could trigger a **transfer-for-value tax**. **26 U.S. Code § 1041** states transfers to a spouse incident to a divorce are not taxable. 

Couples who divorce over the age of 50 are called a **gray divorce**. These couples are more likely to have significant assets with grown children.  Considerations for gray divorce:
* How long will it take to recuperate from the divorce and how with this affect their retirement age?
* The amount and duration of alimony payments
* The possibility of work for the non-working spouse
* Health issues
* Social Security and Medicare benefits

A divorce can have an impact on the client's credit score since long-held joint accounts may be closed and new credit may be obtained (inquiries). Authorized users on credit accounts may negatively impacted the primary account holder's credit score.

The previous provider of medical insurance typically is responsible for providing coverage for the children. The non-working spouse will need to obtain coverage, COBRA is available up to 36 months after the divorce. Married couples of at least 10 years can receive Medicare benefits regardless of the work-history of one of the spouses.

Someone married for at least 10 years that does not remarry, is 62, and is divorced for at least 2 years can claim Social Security on their ex-spouse's record. The ex-spouse does not need to have claimed benefits for the other spouse to claim benefits. 

Custodial accounts for children are divisible as marital property except for UTMA or UGMA accounts, though they may wish to keep the accounts in tact for the benefit of the child. Transfers in some 529 plans can be considered a distribution and subject to taxes and penalties.  The parent who provides a majority of the financial support for the child is responsible for completing the FASFA. Forparents that split financial responsibility, the one with the greater income is responsible for completing the FASFA.  Divorced parents living together are effectively considered marries for the FASFA.  Separated parents living separately are not considered married for the FASFA.

Alimony (aka maintenance) is typically paid to the lower income spouse.  Alimony can be bought out as a single lump sum. Payments are not deductable from taxable income, and payments aren't included in taxable income.

The death of divorced parents may result in assets being transferred to a special needs child, which may cause the child to lose their benefits. Specail needs planning is important in this case.  Special needs trusts survive past a divorce.

Estate planning documents and beneficiary designations should be reviewed after a divorce. 

#### Special Needs Planning

Questions to ask a client who is or has a special needs concern:
* How to pay for medical care for the rest of their life?
* What will happen if their condition worsens?
* Are they eligible for government benefits?

Wealth managers help plan for current and future expenses and devise a plan using all available resources.  The best special needs planning is based on creating a life plan, not just a financial plan.

Planning for a disabled individual:
* Ensure the caregiver is fully protected by evaluating their health, disability and long-term care insurance
* Inventory all resources available including health and disability insurance, settlements or legal claims, long-term care insurance,  and HSAs
* Evaluate public benefits including SSDI, SSI, and Medicaid, which may require low income thresholds that can be overcome using special needs trusts.  Direct transfers out of a disabled individual's name are risky, potentially illegal, and ineffective since Medicaid has a 60 month **lookback period**.

A **special needs trust** allows a disabled person to access additional resources and still remain eligible for public benefits. Special needs trusts can be self-funded (aka first-party trusts, from the disabled person) or via third-party supplemental special needs trusts.  The special needs person is the sole beneficiary. Distributions from speical needs trusts are used to improve the quality of life of the disabled person since public benefits cover medical needs.  The trustee makes discretionary distributions for the beneficiary.  Tax implications and requirements vary by state.

First-party trusts are best for receiving personal property, inheritances, legal settlements, or income payments while avoiding disqualification from Medicaid.  When the disabled person dies, the assets are distributed to the Medicaid (called the **pay back**) first to cover the costs of care, while the remaining assets are distributed to the estate.

a **pooled special needs trust** are created and adminstered by nonprofit organizations to benefit several disabled people.  While there is no Medicaid pay back, the remaining assets remain in the trust.  They are most appropriate for low asset individuals since administrative costs are lower due to pooled expenses.

**Joint accounts** or **custodial accounts** are easier to set up and administer than special needs trusts. These accounts are established between a caregiver and a disabled person.  The caregiver funds the account.  UGMA or UTMA funds are not included in Medicaid resource determination.  The funds are transferred to the child when they reaches majority, triggering income tax.

The **ABLE Act** allows for the creation of ABLE accounts for individuals with disabilities.  An **ABLE account** is opened on behalf of a special needs person. Funds are not included in Medicaid resource determination. Earned income is tax free and distributions are not subject to income tax as long as they are used for qualified expenses. Unqualified expenses are subject to a 10% penalty. Annual contributions are capped. Special needs persons only qualify for ABL accounts if they were disbabled before the age of 26.  Account values are capped the same amounts as 529 plans.  Values over $100,000 may disqualify them for SSI benefits.  An ABLE account can be opened in states other than the state of residence.  ABLE accounts are funder with after tax dollars.

Disinheriting the speciall needs person in favor of the caregiver is not advised since there are no guarantees in place. There are tax credits and deductions available for families with special needs children, including the dependency exemption, child tax credit, and dependent care credit.  The disabled person can use the impairment related work expense deduction, earned income tax credit, and adoption credit for adoption of a child with special needs.  Any individual permanently or totally disabled within the year is qualified.  Qualified relatives have income limits while qualified children do not.  Conversly, there is a residency test for qualified children that does not exist for qualified relatives.  Medical expense deductions can be used for unreimbursed medical costs, costs for a special needs school, and costs to attend medical conferences and seminars related to the disability, though they may be subject to phase out limitations, AGI floors/caps, timing restrictions, and other limitations.
