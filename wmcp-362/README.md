## Tax Strategies

### Federal Income Tax Strategies

* Personal income tax is progressive, meaning the tax rate increases (in brackets) as income increases.
* Gross income is the total income before any deductions.
* Capital gains tax is the tax on the profit from the sale of an asset and are progressively taxed at lower rates than ordinary income.

4 principal types of tax planning strategies:

1. Deferring income to future, lower tax years and accelerating income to lower tax years
1. Shifting income to other tax payers in lower tax brackets
1. Accelerating deductions
1. Converting income into capital gains

Due to the time value of money, a dollar of tax paid in the future has less present value than a dollar of tax paid today.  Discount future tax liabilities to determine present value in order to compare tax strategies.

Tax deferral can be profitable even with higher future rates if investment returns outweigh the rate difference.

#### Analyzing Federal Tax Returns

It's benefical to analyze 2 - 3 years of a client's tax returns to understand trends and outliers.

Understanging implications of investetments and portfolio decisions is key to minimizing tax liability, which may include working with the client's CPA.

The marginal tax rate is the tax rate on the last dollar of income.  Knowing this rate is important for tax planning decisions  because it determines the tax impact of additional income or deductions.

> Marginal Tax Rate = (Tax Owned on Additional Income) / (Additional Income)

The Effective Tax Rate is the tax rate on the total taxable income, which is total tax owed divided by total income.  This rate is important for understanding the overall tax burden and comparing tax rates across different income levels.

> Effective Tax Rate = (Total Tax Owed) / (Total Income)

Increasing a client's AGI can increase their tax liability.

In addition to tax returns, managers should review account statements and tax planning documents to understand the client's financial situation and goals.

#### Income Shifting

Income shifting is the practice of transferring income from high-tax payers to low-tax payers within the same household to reduce the overall tax liability.  This does not work with passive investments involvingchildren or full time college students due to the "kiddie tax", which taxes children's income at the parents' marginal tax rate at amounts greater than $2,600.

#### Capital Gains

Capital gains are typically taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.  Capital gains are calculated as the difference between the **amount realized** (sale price) and the **adjusted basis** of an asset.  The adjusted basis is the original purchase price plus any capital improvements minus depreciation.

A **capital asset** is any property held for investment or used in a trade or business.  This includes stocks, bonds, real estate, and other assets.  They exclude accounts receivable and inventory.  Capital assets held for more than one year are considered long-term and taxed at the long-term capital gains rate (progressive tax brackets of 0%, 15%, or 20%), while those held for less than one year are considered short-term and taxed at the ordinary income tax rate.  Other capital assets include collectibles and certain business assets and are taxed at rate no higher than 28%.

Capital gains rates on **§ 1231 assets** (real property used in a trade or business) are taxed at the same rates as long-term capital gains.  § 1231 assets can be broken down into 2 categories:

1. § 1245 property: personal property or machinery used in a trade or business
1. § 1250 property: non-depreciable business real estate

Losses in both categories are netted against § 1231 gains, and any remaining losses are treated as ordinary losses that offset ordinary income.

§ 1245 property gains up to the amount of depreciation taken on the property are taxed at 20%, while gains in excess of depreciation are taxed at § 1231 rates (long-term capital gains rate).

§ 1250 property gains up to the amount of depreciation taken on the property are taxed at 25%, while gains in excess of depreciation are taxed at § 1231 rates (long-term capital gains rate).

Example 1: Sale of an apartment (§ 1250 property) for $1,350,000, purchased a year ago for $1,000,000, and depreciation taken was $950,000.

> Adjusted basis = $1,000,000 - $950,000 = $50,000
> Gain = $1,350,000 - $50,000 = $1,300,000
>
> The $350,000 appreciation is taxed at 20% = $70,000
> The remaining $950,000 is taxed at 25% = $237,500
> Total tax = $70,000 + $237,500 = $307,500

Example 2: Sale of a  § 1245 property for $1,350,000, purchased a year ago for $1,000,000, and depreciation taken was $950,000.

> Adjusted basis = $1,000,000 - $950,000 = $50,000
> Gain = $1,350,000 - $50,000 = $1,300,000
>
> The $350,000 appreciation is taxed at 15% = $52,500
> The remaining $950,000 is taxed at ordinary income tax rate (for a 37% bracket) = $351,500
> Total tax = $52,500 + $351,500 = $404,000

Capital gains appear on **Schedule D** of the tax return.  The **capital-loss carryover** is used to offset capital gains in future years (like for roth conversions).  **Capital-gain distributions** from investments (e.g. mutual funds) are passed along to shareholders.

Converting ordinary income to capital gains is a primary tax planning strategy for high income clients. One techique is recieving compensation in the form of equity, stock options, and restricted stock.  Another strategy is to hold onto assets for at least a year.  A client can also convert intereset income to qualified dividends, which are taxed at lower rates.

Qualified dividends are paid out as earnings are taxed as ordinary income, but are taxed as capital gains.

Losses on sales of capital assets can be used to offset capital gains in the same tax year, but only up to the amount of the gains.  An additional $3,000 can be used to offset adjusted gross income.  Any remaining losses can be used to offset capital gains in future years or ordinary income.

**The Wash sale rule** states that if a capital asset is sold for a loss and within 30 days before or after the sale, the same asset is repurchased, then the loss is not allowed.  This rule is used to prevent taxpayers from selling assets at a loss and then immediately repurchasing the same asset to avoid recognizing the loss.  This applies to all accounts held by the taxpayer, as well as their spouse's accounts.  A way around this rule is to purchase a similar, but not identical, asset.

For tax planning, it's important to understand the 3 different types of tax rates:

1. **The marginal tax rate**: the tax rate on the last dollar of income.
1. **The average tax rate**: the total tax owed divided by total income.
1. **The effective tax rate**: the tax rate on the total taxable income.

#### How Investments Impact Income

1. Capital-gains tax: capital gains rates increase as income increase
1. Alternative minimum tax (AMT): a separate tax calculation that may apply to certain taxpayers, particularly those with complex financial situations.  Higher income taxpayers may want to accelerate income to go from the 37% bracket to the 28% AMT rate.
1. State Income Tax Brackets: vary by state and are generally increase as income increase.
1. Itemized deductions: some deductions are phased out for higher income taxpayers.
1. Net investment income tax: applies to investment income if AGI/MAGI is over $200,000 for singles ($250,000 for married couples).  IRA income above the threshold can make capital gains subject to this tax.
1. IRMAA (Initial Retirement Monthly Amount): based on 4 different thresholds of MAGI that involves adding back tax-exempt interest back to AGI.
1. Roth IRA conversion: increases AGI and may trigger tax at the marginal tax rate on conversion income.  It may be beneficial to convert IRAs to Roth before RMDs begin.  Conversions are best done in a year when the client is in a lower tax bracket.
1. Charitable contributions: QCD (qualified charitable distribution) from IRA accounts are not included in AGI, but count toward the RMD requirement.

#### Tax Loss Harvesting

Tax loss harvesting is the practice of selling assets at a loss to offset capital gains and reduce taxable income.

Order of losses applied to gains:

1. Long-term capital losses offset long-term capital gains first, then short-term capital gains
1. Then short-term capital losses offset short-term capital gains
1. Additional losses can be used to offset up to $3,000 of taxable income
1. Any remaining losses can be carried forward to future years

Benefits of tax loss harvesting:

1. **Net Benefit Returns**: estimated net benefit returns range from 25 to 50 basis points per year.
2. **Increasing Tax Sheltering**: reduce taxes during high tax bracket years, pay taxes on the gains in low tax bracket years
3. **Reduce Tax Burdens Today**
4. **Enable Investors to Avoid Taxes**

Tax loss harvesting works best when assets are purchased in multiple lots over time, where the basis of each lot is known.  Tax loss harvesting can also be done in conjunction with rebalancing the portfolio to optimize tax efficiency.

Investors in the 0% tax bracket should not harvest losses because they do not need to reduce taxes.  These investors should consider harvesting gains instead.

#### Tax Gain Harvesting

Tax gain harvesting is the practice of selling assets at a gain to offset capital losses and reduce taxable income. Investors in low income tax brackets should consider harvesting gains.  The wash sale rule does not apply to tax gain harvesting.

#### Qualified Business Income Deduction

The qualified business income deduction allows business owners to deduct 20% of their qualified business income from their taxable income.  This deduction is available for individuals, estates, and trusts.  The deduction starts to phase out for taxpayers with MAGI over $200,000 for singles and $400,000 for married couples, and is fully phased out for taxpayers with MAGI over $150,000 for singles and $300,000 for married couples.  The deduction is also phased out for **Specified Service Businesses**.

### Taxation of Social Security

Since 1984, Social Security benefits are generally taxable for high income taxpayers.  If Social Security benefits are claimed before full retirement age, up to 50% of benefits may be taxable above the $22,000 threshold.

**Provisional Income** is used to determine if Social Security benefits are taxable.  It is the sum of MAGI + tax-exempt interest + half of Social Security benefits.  If provisional income is less than $25,000 for singles or $32,000 for married couples, then benefits are not taxed.  If provisional income is between $25,000 and $34,000 for singles or $32,000 and $44,000 for married couples, then up to 50% of benefits may be taxable.  If provisional income is greater than $34,000 for singles or $44,000 for married couples, then up to 85% of benefits may be taxable.

The **tax torpedo** may occur if RMDs cause additional dollars of Social Security benefits to be taxable.  An additional dollar of income can cause multiple taxes to be paid.

### Alternative Minimum Tax

The alternative minimum tax (AMT) is a separate and parallel tax system that may apply to certain taxpayers, particularly those with complex financial situations.  Under the AMT, taxpayers are disallowed certain deductions and credits that are allowed under the regular tax system.  Higher income taxpayers may want to accelerate income to go from the 37% bracket to the 28% AMT rate.

To calculate AMT, the taxpayer's income is compared to the AMT exemption amount.  If the taxpayer's income is less than the exemption amount, then the taxpayer is not subject to AMT.  The exemption amount is adjusted for inflation and is currently $75,900 for single filers and $114,600 for married couples.

The AMT is calculated using a 26% flat tax rate on the taxpayer's positive AMT income of $232,600 or less.  The tax rate is 28% for AMT income above $232,600.  The AMT income is the taxpayer's taxable income plus the AMT adjustments minus the AMT exemption amount.  The AMT is then compared to the regular tax liability to determine the amount of tax owed.  If the AMT is greater than the regular tax liability, then the taxpayer is subject to AMT.

The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 made the exemption amount increase and the AMT rate was decreased.  However, the exemption amount is scheduled to expire after 2025.

5 rules for coping with AMT:

1. **Manage deductions**: Prepay state and local taxes in years when the AMT is not expected to be owed.
1. **Manage inclusion of income**: Accelerate income when the AMT is expected to be owed and when the AMT is lower than the regular tax rate.
1. **Manage realization of capital gains**: Avoid realizing excessive capital gains that trigger the AMT.
1. **Charitable contributions**: Avoid making charitable contributions in years when the AMT is expected to be owed.
1. **Roth conversion planning and Exercising stock options**: Convert IRAs to Roth and exercise stock options in years when the AMT is expected to be owed.

### Estate and Inheritance Taxes

The estate and gift tax systems are interralated/unified in that they share the same tax table and one exemption amount per taxpayer.  The exemption amount has waivered from $5 million to 13 million and is indexed for inflation.  The estate and gift tax is 40% on amounts above the exemption amount.  The estate tax is paid from the estate and the gift tax is paid by the donor.  The "unified credit" is the tax that would have been paid on the federal exemption amount, which is 40% of the exemption amount.

Example: A client has $40 million, who does a charitable contribution of $10 million.  The federal tax exemption is $10 million.

> Taxable estate = $40 million - $10 million = $30 million
> Tax on $30 million = $30 million * 40% = $12 million
> Unified credit = $10 million * 40% = $4 million
> Tax on taxable estate = $12 million - $4 million = $8 million

Tax-free gifts and inheritances are not subject to the estate tax.  There is a $18,000 annual gift tax exclusion per individual.  Medical and tuition expenses (called "qualified gifts") are excluded as long as the donor is alive.

A **qualified personal residence trust** (QPRT) is a trust that allows the grantor to retain a life estate in the property and transfer the remainder interest to the trust beneficiaries.  The grantor can live in the property for a term of years and then the property is transferred to the beneficiaries tax-free.  The duration of a QPRT should end well before the grantor's life expectancy, otherwise the property will be subject to estate tax at the grantor's death.

#### Impact of the Wealth Transfer Tax System

**Portability** means if a spouse dies, the deceased spouse's unused exemption amount is added to the surviving spouse's exemption amount (Form 706 must be filed).  A married couple could shelter $26 million from federal wealth transfer taxes.  Exemption amounts are set to phase out in 2025 (50% reduction).

Life insurance are included in the gross estate for estate tax purposes, even if the policy was transferred within 3 years of death.

#### Gifting

Making lifetime gifts is one of the most effective ways to trasnfer wealth since it can avoid estate, wealth transfer, and gift tax.


The **Federal Gift Tax** is a tax on the transfer of property over one's lifetime.  A **direct gift** is a transfer of property from one individual to another without an intermediary.  A **indirect gift** is a transfer of property through an intermediary, such as a trust or corporation or making payments to the donee's bills.  The tax is calculated at the time of the transfer, and is only imposed if the transfer is completed, though the donee may not receive the property until a later date (e.g. a trust).  Gifting to trusts is a common way to avoid gift tax.

Form 709 is required to be filed if a taxable gift is made.

Exclusions:
* Annual gift tax exclusion: can be applied to each donee (e.g. spouse), called **gift splitting**.  529 plan contributions can be made at 5x the exclusion amount.
* Qualifite gifts: tuition or medical expenses and must be paid directly to the institution or provider.

Deductions:
* Marital deduction: a gift to a spouse is deductible and is unlimited.
* Charitable deduction: a gift to a qualified charity is deductible.

Taxable gifts and taxable estate transfers are combined to determine the **unified credit** which can be applied against taxable gifts and estate transfers.  The unified credit is the amount of tax that would have been paid on the federal exemption amount.  The gift and estate tax is progressive, capping out at the highest marginal tax rate or 40%.


Donors should file returns even when the taxable status is uncertain since donee receives a 3 year statute of limitations on the IRS examining the gift.

When gifting real estate, it's best to do it with property with high appreciation potential.  If the property has appreciated, then it's best to after death so that the donee can receive a step-up in basis, otherwise the donee will be subject to capital gains tax on the appreciation.  For losses, it's best to do it before death so that the donor can take a loss on the sale of the property since the loss doesn't transfer to the donee after death.  Gifting property that is secured by a loan can cause tax problems for the donor.

#### Death and Taxes

The federal estate tax applies to only the top 1/2 of 1% of people.  The exemption shelteres 11 million for singles and 22 million for married couples (indexed for inflation).  Issues concerning property situs and domicile are important to consider when planning for estate tax after death.

States vary in their estate tax laws, though less than 1/2 of states have their own estate tax.  The state of domicile dictates probate laws and estate tax laws.

To prevent issues with state estate tax:
* Identify the situs and titling of all the client's assets.
* Determine the applicable state inheritance and estate tax laws.
* Continue to monitor the client's asset holdings.

## Tax Sheltering

Tax sheltering is the practice of reducing taxable income by taking advantage of tax-favored investments and strategies.  Individuals with a high marginal tax rate benefit the most from tax sheltering.

Realized gains and losses are taxed at the ordinary income tax rate if held for less than a year and at the capital gains tax rate if held for more than a year.  Unrealized gains and losses are not taxed and are a form of tax sheltering if client's sell the asset in a year of a lower tax rate than the year the asset was purchased.  

Tax sheltered accounts can help client's avoid withthdrawls since they are earmarked for specific purposes and have a 10% penalty for early withdrawals (like a lock box).  There are also pshcyholgical costs to withdrawing from tax sheltered accounts.  In behavioral finance theory, the lock box is a **commitment device** that helps the client avoid withdrawing from the account.  Realizing gains in a tax sheltered account do not create a taxable event.

Tax sheltering risks include:
* Senstitive to tax law changes
* Sensitive to changing income tax rates
* Sensitive to income and filing status

Tax sheltering benefits include:
* Creates a lock box
* Gives control over tax liability
* Moves tax burden to future years when tax rates are lower
* Having lower losses due to tax increases goal success

Types of tax sheltered accounts:
* Tax-deferred accounts (tax is deferred until withdrawal): 401(k), IRA, Roth IRA, 403(b), 457(b)
* Tax-exempt accounts (tax is paid ahead of time): Roth IRA, Roth 401(k), Roth 403(b), Roth 457(b)
* HSA (health savings account): tax-free contributions and withdrawals, tax-deferred earnings, tax-free withdrawals for qualified medical expenses
* Real estate: increase in value is unrealized, and an exemption applies to the gain when the property is sold
* Private business assets: appreciation is deferred until the asset is sold
* Taxable accounts: tax is paid on realized gains and losses
* Cash-value life insurance and annuities: tax-deferred growth, tax-free withdrawals for qualified medical expenses

Mutual funds and ETFs are not tax sheltered since they are **pass-through entities**.  The income is taxed at the investor's marginal tax rate.

Investments held in taxable accounts may have a lower tax rate than tax-deferred accounts in some cases.
